This project allows a user to develop and run messaging microservices using Spring Integration and run them locally, or in the cloud, or even on Spring XD. Just add `@EnableBinding` and run your app as a Spring Boot app (single application context). You just need to connect to the physical broker for the bindings, which is automatic if the relevant binder implementation is available on the classpath. The sample uses Redis.

Here's a sample source module (output channel only):

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan(basePackageClasses=TimerSource.class)
public class ModuleApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ModuleApplication.class, args);
  }

}

@Configuration
@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class TimerSource {

  @Value("${format}")
  private String format;

  @Bean
  @InboundChannelAdapter(value = Source.OUTPUT, poller = @Poller(fixedDelay = "${fixedDelay}", maxMessagesPerPoll = "1"))
  public MessageSource<String> timerMessageSource() {
    return () -> new GenericMessage<>(new SimpleDateFormat(format).format(new Date()));
  }

}
----

`@EnableBinding` is parameterized by an interface (in this case `Source`) which declares input and output channels. `Source`, `Sink` and `Processor` are provided off the shelf, but you can define others. Here's the definition of `Source`:

[source,java]
----
public interface Source {
  @Output("output")
  MessageChannel output();
}
----

The `@Output` annotation is used to identify output channels (messages leaving the module) and `@Input` is used to identify input channels (messages entering the module). It is optionally parameterized by a channel name - if the name is not provided the method name is used instead. An implementation of the interface is created for you and can be used in the application context by autowiring it, e.g. into a test case:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = ModuleApplication.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
@DirtiesContext
public class ModuleApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private Source source

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() {
		assertNotNull(this.source.output());
	}

}
----

NOTE: In this case there is only one `Source` in the application context so there is no need to qualify it when it is autowired. If there is ambiguity, e.g. if you are composing one module from some others, you can use `@Bindings` qualifier to inject a specific channel set. The `@Bindings` qualifier takes a parameter which is the class that carries the `@EnableBinding` annotation (in this case the `TimerSource`).

== Multiple Input or Output Channels

A module can have multiple input or output channels all defined either as `@Input` and `@Output` methods in an interface (preferrable) or as bean definitions. Instead of just one channel named "input" or "output" you can add multiple `MessageChannel` methods annotated `@Input` or `@Output` and the names are converted to external channel names on the broker. The external channel names can be specified as properties that consist of the channel names prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.bindings` (e.g. `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input` or `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output`). External channel names can have a channel type as a colon-separated prefix, and the semantics of the external bus channel changes accordingly. For example, you can have two `MessageChannels` called "output" and "foo" in a module with `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output=bar` and `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.foo=topic:foo`, and the result is 2 external channels called "bar" and "topic:foo".

== Samples

There are several samples, all running on the redis transport (so you need redis running locally to test them).


NOTE: The main set of samples are "vanilla" in the sense that they are not deployable as XD modules by the current generation (1.x) of XD. You can still interact with an XD system using the appropriate naming convention for input and output channel names (`<stream>.<index>` format).

* `source` is a Java config version of the classic "timer" module from Spring XD. It has a "fixedDelay" option (in milliseconds) for the period between emitting messages.

* `sink` is a Java config version of the classic "log" module from Spring XD. It has no options (but some could easily be added), and just logs incoming messages at INFO level.

* `transform` is a simple pass through logging transformer (just logs the incoming message and passes it on).

* `double` is a combination of 2 modules defined locally (a source and a sink, so the whole app is self contained).

* `extended` is a multi-module mashup of `source | transform | transform | sink`, where the modules are defined in the other samples and referred to in this app just as dependencies.

If you run the source and the sink and point them at the same redis instance (e.g. do nothing to get the one on localhost, or the one they are both bound to as a service on Cloud Foundry) then they will form a "stream" and start talking to each other. All the samples have friendly JMX and Actuator endpoints for inspecting what is going on in the system.

== Module or App

Code using this library can be deployed as a standalone app or as an XD module. In standalone mode you app will run happily as a service or in any PaaS (Cloud Foundry, Lattice, Heroku, Azure, etc.). Depending on whether your main aim is to develop an XD module and you just want to test it locally using the standalone mode, or if the ultimate goal is a standalone app, there are some things that you might do differently.

=== Fat JAR

You can run in standalone mode from your IDE for testing. To run in production you can create an executable (or "fat") JAR using the standard Spring Boot tooling.
// To be confirmed...
// the executable JAR has a load of stuff in it that isn't needed if it's going to be deployed as an XD module. In that case you are better off with the normal JAR packaging provided by Maven or Gradle.

== Making Standalone Modules Talk to Each Other

The `[input,output]ChannelName` are used to create physical endpoints in the external broker (e.g. `queue.<channelName>` in Redis).

For an XD module the channel names are `<group>.<index>` and a source (output only) has `index=0` (the default) and downstream modules have the same group but incremented index, with a sink module (input only) having the highest index. To listen to the output from a running XD module, just use the same "group" name and an index 1 larger than the app before it in the chain.

> Note: since the same naming conventions are used in XD, you can steal messages from or send messages to an existing XD stream by copying the stream name (to `spring.cloud.streams.group`) and knowing the index of the XD module you want to interact with.

== Building

:jdkversion: 1.8

=== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install JDK {jdkversion}.

Spring Cloud uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing

----
$ ./mvnw install
----

NOTE: You can also install Maven (>=3.3.3) yourself and run the `mvn` command
in place of `./mvnw` in the examples below. If you do that you also
might need to add `-P spring` if your local Maven settings do not
contain repository declarations for spring pre-release artifacts.

NOTE: Be aware that you might need to increase the amount of memory
available to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with
a value like `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`. We try to cover this in
the `.mvn` configuration, so if you find you have to do it to make a
build succeed, please raise a ticket to get the settings added to
source control.

For hints on how to build the project look in `.travis.yml` if there
is one. There should be a "script" and maybe "install" command. Also
look at the "services" section to see if any services need to be
running locally (e.g. mongo or rabbit).  Ignore the git-related bits
that you might find in "before_install" since they're related to setting git
credentials and you already have those.

The projects that require middleware generally include a
`docker-compose.yml`, so consider using
http://compose.docker.io/[Docker Compose] to run the middeware servers
in Docker containers. See the README in the
https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts[scripts demo
repository] for specific instructions about the common cases of mongo,
rabbit and redis.

NOTE: migration to the Maven wrapper (`./mvnw`) is underway. If you
find a project that doesn't have it yet, raise an issue to get it
added, and build with the command from `.travis.yml` (usually
`mvn install -s .settings.xml`).

=== Documentation

The spring-cloud-build module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
`src/main/asciidoc`. As part of that process it will look for a
`README.adoc` and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to `${main.basedir}`
(defaults to `${basedir}`, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
http://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue.

==== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

Unfortunately m2e does not yet support Maven 3.3, so once the projects
are imported into Eclipse you will also need to tell m2eclipse to use
the `.settings.xml` file for the projects.  If you do not do this you
may see many different errors related to the POMs in the
projects.  Open your Eclipse preferences, expand the Maven
preferences, and select User Settings.  In the User Settings field
click Browse and navigate to the Spring Cloud project you imported
selecting the `.settings.xml` file in that project.  Click Apply and
then OK to save the preference changes.

NOTE: Alternatively you can copy the repository settings from https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/.settings.xml[`.settings.xml`] into your own `~/.m2/settings.xml`.

==== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.

==== Adding Project Lombok Agent

Spring Cloud uses http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html[Project Lombok]
to generate getters and setters etc. Compiling from the command line this
shouldn't cause any problems, but in an IDE you need to add an agent
to the JVM. Full instructions can be found in the Lombok website. The
sign that you need to do this is a lot of compiler errors to do with
missing methods and fields, e.g.

[indent=0]
----

==== Importing into other IDEs
Maven is well supported by most Java IDEs. Refer to you vendor documentation.


== Contributing

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup[contributor's agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://github.com/spring-cloud/build/tree/master/eclipse-coding-conventions.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).
