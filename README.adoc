This project allows a user to develop and run messaging microservices using Spring Integration and run them locally or in the cloud. Just add `@EnableBinding` and run your app as a Spring Boot app (single application context).

Since version 1.1, Spring Cloud Stream follows a decentralized model where the core components and the binder implementations are developed and released separately.
This repository contains the core components of the project and does not contain any binder implementations.

The repository for the Spring Cloud Stream Release Train is here: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-starters

Information on the Spring Cloud Stream release train can be found here: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-starters/wiki#release-notes.

=== Code formatting guidelines

* The directory `eclipse` contains two files that can be used to configure the formatting rules in your IDE: `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` for the majority of the code formatting rules and `eclipse.importorder` to order the import statements.

* In Eclipse you import these files by navigating `Windows -> Preferences` and then the menu items `Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter` and `Preferences > Java > Code Style > Organize Imports` respectively.

* In `IntelliJ`, install the plugin `Eclipse Code Formatter`.
You can find it by searching the "Browse Repositories" under the plugin option within `IntelliJ` (Once installed you will need to reboot Intellij for it to take effect).
Then navigate to `Intellij IDEA > Preferences` and select the Eclipse Code Formatter.
Select the `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file for the field `Eclipse Java Formatter config file` and the file `eclipse.importorder` for the field `Import order`.
Enable the `Eclipse code formatter` by clicking `Use the Eclipse code formatter` then click the *OK* button.
** NOTE: If you configure the `Eclipse Code Formatter` from `File > Other Settings > Default Settings` it will set this policy across all of your Intellij projects.
