This guide describes the RabbitMQ implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder.
It contains information about its design, usage and configuration options, as well as information on how the Stream Cloud Stream concepts map into RabbitMQ specific constructs.
--

== Usage

For using the RabbitMQ binder, you just need to add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, using the following Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can also use the Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ Starter.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>

== RabbitMQ Binder Overview

A simplified diagram of how the RabbitMQ binder operates can be seen below.

.RabbitMQ Binder
image::rabbit-binder.png[width=300,scaledwidth="50%"]

The RabbitMQ Binder implementation maps each destination to a `TopicExchange`.
For each consumer group, a `Queue` will be bound to that `TopicExchange`.
Each consumer instance have a corresponding RabbitMQ `Consumer` instance for its group's `Queue`.
For partitioned producers/consumers the queues are suffixed with the partition index and use the partition index as routing key.

Using the `autoBindDlq` option, you can optionally configure the binder to create and configure dead-letter queues (DLQs) (and a dead-letter exchange `DLX`).
The dead letter queue has the name of the destination, appended with `.dlq`.
If retry is enabled (`maxAttempts > 1`) failed messages will be delivered to the DLQ.
If retry is disabled (`maxAttempts = 1`), you should set `requeueRejected` to `false` (default) so that a failed message will be routed to the DLQ, instead of being requeued.
In addition, `republishToDlq` causes the binder to publish a failed message to the DLQ (instead of rejecting it); this enables additional information to be added to the message in headers, such as the stack trace in the `x-exception-stacktrace` header.
This option does not need retry enabled; you can republish a failed message after just one attempt.
Starting with _version 1.2_, you can configure the delivery mode of republished messages; see property `republishDeliveryMode`.

IMPORTANT: Setting `requeueRejected` to `true` will cause the message to be requeued and redelivered continually, which is likely not what you want unless the failure issue is transient.
In general, it's better to enable retry within the binder by setting `maxAttempts` to greater than one, or set `republishToDlq` to `true`.

See <<rabbit-binder-properties>> for more information about these properties.

The framework does not provide any standard mechanism to consume dead-letter messages (or to re-route them back to the primary queue).
Some options are described in <<rabbit-dlq-processing>>.

[NOTE]
====
When *multiple* RabbitMQ binders are used in a Spring Cloud Stream application, it is important to disable 'RabbitAutoConfiguration' to avoid the same configuration from `RabbitAutoConfiguration` being applied to the two binders.
====

Starting with _version 1.3_, the `RabbitMessageChannelBinder` creates an internal `ConnectionFactory` copy for the non-transactional producers to avoid dead locks on consumers when shared, cached connections are blocked because of https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html[Memory Alarm] on Broker.

== Configuration Options

This section contains settings specific to the RabbitMQ Binder and bound channels.

For general binding configuration options and properties,
please refer to the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-core-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-stream-overview.adoc#configuration-options[Spring Cloud Stream core documentation].

[[rabbit-binder-properties]]
=== RabbitMQ Binder Properties

By default, the RabbitMQ binder uses Spring Boot's `ConnectionFactory`, and it therefore supports all Spring Boot configuration options for RabbitMQ.
(For reference, consult the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties[Spring Boot documentation].)
RabbitMQ configuration options use the `spring.rabbitmq` prefix.

In addition to Spring Boot options, the RabbitMQ binder supports the following properties:

spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.adminAddresses::
  A comma-separated list of RabbitMQ management plugin URLs.
Only used when `nodes` contains more than one entry.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.rabbitmq.addresses`.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.nodes::
  A comma-separated list of RabbitMQ node names.
When more than one entry, used to locate the server address where a queue is located.
Each entry in this list must have a corresponding entry in `spring.rabbitmq.addresses`.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.binder.compressionLevel::
  Compression level for compressed bindings.
See `java.util.zip.Deflater`.

====
In the case of RabbitMQ, content type headers can be set by external applications.
Spring Cloud Stream supports them as part of an extended internal protocol used for any type of transport (including transports, such as Kafka, that do not normally support headers).

== Retry With the RabbitMQ Binder

=== Overview

When retry is enabled within the binder, the listener container thread is suspended for any back off periods that are configured.
This might be important when strict ordering is required with a single consumer but for other use cases it prevents other messages from being processed on that thread.
An alternative to using binder retry is to set up dead lettering with time to live on the dead-letter queue (DLQ), as well as dead-letter configuration on the DLQ itself.
See <<rabbit-binder-properties>> for more information about the properties discussed here.
Example configuration to enable this feature:

* Set `autoBindDlq` to `true` - the binder will create a DLQ; you can optionally specify a name in `deadLetterQueueName`
* Set `dlqTtl` to the back off time you want to wait between redeliveries
* Set the `dlqDeadLetterExchange` to the default exchange - expired messages from the DLQ will be routed to the original queue since the default `deadLetterRoutingKey` is the queue name (`destination.group`)

To force a message to be dead-lettered, either throw an `AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException`, or set `requeueRejected` to `true` and throw any exception.

The loop will continue without end, which is fine for transient problems but you may want to give up after some number of attempts.
Fortunately, RabbitMQ provides the `x-death` header which allows you to determine how many cycles have occurred.

To acknowledge a message after giving up, throw an `ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException`.

=== Putting it All Together

[source]
---
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=myDestination
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=consumerGroup
#disable binder retries
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.max-attempts=1
#dlx/dlq setup
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.auto-bind-dlq=true
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.dlq-ttl=5000
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.dlq-dead-letter-exchange=
---

This configuration creates an exchange `myDestination` with queue `myDestination.consumerGroup` bound to a topic exchange with a wildcard routing key `#`.
It creates a DLQ bound to a direct exchange `DLX` with routing key `myDestination.consumerGroup`.
When messages are rejected, they are routed to the DLQ.
After 5 seconds, the message expires and is routed to the original queue using the queue name as the routing key.

.Spring Boot application
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class XDeathApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(XDeathApplication.class, args);
    }

    @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
    public void listen(String in, @Header(name = "x-death", required = false) Map<?,?> death) {
        if (death != null && death.get("count").equals(3L)) {
            // giving up - don't send to DLX
            throw new ImmediateAcknowledgeAmqpException("Failed after 4 attempts");
        }
        throw new AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException("failed");
    }

}
----

Notice that the count property in the `x-death` header is a `Long`.

[[rabbit-error-channels]]
== Error Channels

Starting with _version 1.3_, the binder unconditionally sends exceptions to an error channel for each consumer destination, and can be configured to send async producer send failures to an error channel too.
See <<binder-error-channels>> for more information.

With rabbitmq, there are two types of send failures:

* returned messages
* negatively acknowledged https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html[Publisher Confirms]

The latter is rare; quoting the RabbitMQ documentation "[A nack] will only be delivered if an internal error occurs in the Erlang process responsible for a queue.".

As well as enabling producer error channels as described in <<binder-error-channels>>, the RabbitMQ binder will only send messages to the channels if the connection factory is appropriately configured:

* `ccf.setPublisherConfirms(true);`
* `ccf.setPublisherReturns(true);`

When using spring boot configuration for the connection factory, set properties:

* `spring.rabbitmq.publisher-confirms`
* `spring.rabbitmq.publisher-returns`

The payload of the `ErrorMessage` for a returned message is a `ReturnedAmqpMessageException` with properties:

* `failedMessage` - the spring-messaging `Message<?>` that failed to be sent.
* `amqpMessage` - the raw spring-amqp `Message`
* `replyCode` - an integer value indicating the reason for the failure (e.g. 312 - No route)
* `replyText` - a text value indicating the reason for the failure e.g. `NO_ROUTE`.
* `exchange` - the exchange to which the message was published.
* `routingKey` - the routing key used when the message was published.

For negatively acknowledged confirms, the payload is a `NackedAmqpMessageException` with properties:

* `failedMessage` - the spring-messaging `Message<?>` that failed to be sent.
* `nackReason` - a reason (if available; you may need to examine the broker logs for more information).

There is no automatic handling of these exceptions (such as sending to a <<rabbit-dlq-processing, Dead-Letter queue>>); you can consume these exceptions with your own Spring Integration flow.
