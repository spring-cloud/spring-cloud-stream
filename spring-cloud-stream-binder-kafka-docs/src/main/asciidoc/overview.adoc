This guide describes the Apache Kafka implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder.
It contains information about its design, usage and configuration options, as well as information on how the Stream Cloud Stream concepts map into Apache Kafka specific constructs.
In addition, this guide also explains the Kafka Streams binding capabilities of Spring Cloud Stream.
--

== Usage

To use Apache Kafka binder all you need is to add `spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka` as a dependency to your Spring Cloud Stream application. Below is a Maven example:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can also use the Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Starter.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Apache Kafka Binder Overview

A simplified diagram of how the Apache Kafka binder operates can be seen below.

.Kafka Binder
image::kafka-binder.png[width=300,scaledwidth="50%"]

The Apache Kafka Binder implementation maps each destination to an Apache Kafka topic.
The consumer group maps directly to the same Apache Kafka concept.
Partitioning also maps directly to Apache Kafka partitions as well.

The binder currently uses the Apache Kafka `kafka-clients` 1.0.0 jar and is designed to be used with a broker at least that version.
This client can communicate with older brokers (refer to the Kafka documentation), but certain features may not be available.
For example, with versions earlier than 0.11.x.x, native headers are not supported.
Also, 0.11.x.x does not support the `autoAddPartitions` property.

== Configuration Options

This section contains the configuration options used by the Apache Kafka binder.

For common configuration options and properties pertaining to binder, refer to the <<binding-properties,core documentation>>.

=== Kafka Binder Properties

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers::
  A list of brokers to which the Kafka binder will connect.
+
Default: `localhost`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.defaultBrokerPort::
  `brokers` allows hosts specified with or without port information (e.g., `host1,host2:port2`).
This sets the default port when no port is configured in the broker list.
+
Default: `9092`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration::
  Key/Value map of client properties (both producers and consumer) passed to all clients created by the binder.
Due to the fact that these properties will be used by both producers and consumers, usage should be restricted to common properties, for example, security settings.
+
Default: Empty map.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.headers::
  The list of custom headers that will be transported by the binder.
Only required when communicating with older applications (<= 1.3.x) with a `kafka-clients` version < 0.11.0.0; newer versions support headers natively.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.healthTimeout::
  The time to wait to get partition information in seconds; default 60.
Health will report as down if this timer expires.
+
Default: 10.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.requiredAcks::
  The number of required acks on the broker.
+
Default: `1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.minPartitionCount::
  Effective only if `autoCreateTopics` or `autoAddPartitions` is set.
The global minimum number of partitions that the binder will configure on topics on which it produces/consumes data.
It can be superseded by the `partitionCount` setting of the producer or by the value of `instanceCount` * `concurrency` settings of the producer (if either is larger).
+
Default: `1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.replicationFactor::
  The replication factor of auto-created topics if `autoCreateTopics` is active.
Can be overriden on each binding.
+
Default: `1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoCreateTopics::
  If set to `true`, the binder will create new topics automatically.
If set to `false`, the binder will rely on the topics being already configured.
In the latter case, if the topics do not exist, the binder will fail to start.
Of note, this setting is independent of the `auto.topic.create.enable` setting of the broker and it does not influence it: if the server is set to auto-create topics, they may be created as part of the metadata retrieval request, with default broker settings.
+
Default: `true`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoAddPartitions::
  If set to `true`, the binder will create add new partitions if required.
If set to `false`, the binder will rely on the partition size of the topic being already configured.
If the partition count of the target topic is smaller than the expected value, the binder will fail to start.
+
Default: `false`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.transactionIdPrefix::
  Enable transactions in the binder; see `transaction.id` in the Kafka documentation and https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/_reference.html#transactions[Transactions] in the `spring-kafka` documentation.
  When transactions are enabled, individual `producer` properties are ignored and all producers use the `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.*` properties.
+
Default `null` (no transactions)
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.*::
  Global producer properties for producers in a transactional binder.
  See `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.transactionIdPrefix` and <<kafka-producer-properties>> and the general producer properties supported by all binders.
+
Default: See individual producer properties.

[[kafka-consumer-properties]]
=== Kafka Consumer Properties

The following properties are available for Kafka consumers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<channelName>.consumer.`.

admin.configuration::
A `Map` of Kafka topic properties used when provisioning topics.
e.g. `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.input.consumer.admin.configuration.message.format.version=0.9.0.0`
+
Default: none.

admin.replicas-assignment::
A Map<Integer, List<Integer>> of replica assignments, with the key being the partition and value the assignments.
Used when provisioning new topics.
See `NewTopic` javadocs in the `kafka-clients` jar.
+
Default: none.

admin.replication-factor::
The replication factor to use when provisioning topics; overrides the binder-wide setting.
Ignored if `replicas-assignments` is present.
+
Default: none (the binder-wide default of 1 is used).

autoRebalanceEnabled::
When `true`, topic partitions will be automatically rebalanced between the members of a consumer group.
When `false`, each consumer will be assigned a fixed set of partitions based on `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex`.
This requires both `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` properties to be set appropriately on each launched instance.
The property `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` must typically be greater than 1 in this case.
+
Default: `true`.
autoCommitOffset::
  Whether to autocommit offsets when a message has been processed.
If set to `false`, a header with the key `kafka_acknowledgment` of the type `org.springframework.kafka.support.Acknowledgment` header will be present in the inbound message.
Applications may use this header for acknowledging messages.
See the examples section for details.
When this property is set to `false`, Kafka binder will set the ack mode to `org.springframework.kafka.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer.AckMode.MANUAL`.
+
Default: `true`.
autoCommitOnError::
  Effective only if `autoCommitOffset` is set to `true`.
If set to `false` it suppresses auto-commits for messages that result in errors, and will commit only for successful messages, allows a stream to automatically replay from the last successfully processed message, in case of persistent failures.
If set to `true`, it will always auto-commit (if auto-commit is enabled).
If not set (default), it effectively has the same value as `enableDlq`, auto-committing erroneous messages if they are sent to a DLQ, and not committing them otherwise.
+
Default: not set.
resetOffsets::
Whether to reset offsets on the consumer to the value provided by startOffset.
+
Default: `false`.
startOffset::
  The starting offset for new groups.
Allowed values: `earliest`, `latest`.
If the consumer group is set explicitly for the consumer 'binding' (via `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.group`), then 'startOffset' is set to `earliest`; otherwise it is set to `latest` for the `anonymous` consumer group.
Also see `resetOffsets`.
+
Default: null (equivalent to `earliest`).
enableDlq::
  When set to true, it will send enable DLQ behavior for the consumer.
  By default, messages that result in errors will be forwarded to a topic named `error.<destination>.<group>`.
  The DLQ topic name can be configurable via the property `dlqName`.
  This provides an alternative option to the more common Kafka replay scenario for the case when the number of errors is relatively small and replaying the entire original topic may be too cumbersome.
  See <<kafka-dlq-processing>> processing for more information.
  Starting with _version 2.0_, messages sent to the DLQ topic are enhanced with the following headers: `x-original-topic`, `x-exception-message` and `x-exception-stacktrace` as `byte[]`.
+
Default: `false`.
configuration::
  Map with a key/value pair containing generic Kafka consumer properties.
+
Default: Empty map.
dlqName::
  The name of the DLQ topic to receive the error messages.
+
Default: null (If not specified, messages that result in errors will be forwarded to a topic named `error.<destination>.<group>`).
dlqProducerProperties::
  Using this, dlq specific producer properties can be set.
  All the properties available through kafka producer properties can be set through this property.
+
Default: Default Kafka producer properties.
standardHeaders::
  Indicates which standard headers are populated by the inbound channel adapter.
  `none`, `id`, `timestamp` or `both`.
  Useful if using native deserialization and the first component to receive a message needs an `id` (such as an aggregator that is configured to use a JDBC message store).
+
Default: `none`
converterBeanName::
  The name of a bean that implements `RecordMessageConverter`; used in the inbound channel adapter to replace the default `MessagingMessageConverter`.
+
Default: `null`
idleEventInterval::
  The interval, in milliseconds between events indicating that no messages have recently been received.
  Use an `ApplicationListener<ListenerContainerIdleEvent>` to receive these events.
  See <<pause-resume>> for a usage example.
+
Default: `30000`

[[kafka-producer-properties]]
=== Kafka Producer Properties

The following properties are available for Kafka producers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<channelName>.producer.`.

admin.configuration::
A `Map` of Kafka topic properties used when provisioning new topics.
e.g. `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.input.consumer.admin.configuration.message.format.version=0.9.0.0`
+
Default: none.

admin.replicas-assignment::
A Map<Integer, List<Integer>> of replica assignments, with the key being the partition and value the assignments.
Used when provisioning new topics.
See `NewTopic` javadocs in the `kafka-clients` jar.
+
Default: none.

admin.replication-factor::
The replication factor to use when provisioning new topics; overrides the binder-wide setting.
Ignored if `replicas-assignments` is present.
+
Default: none (the binder-wide default of 1 is used).

bufferSize::
  Upper limit, in bytes, of how much data the Kafka producer will attempt to batch before sending.
+
Default: `16384`.
sync::
  Whether the producer is synchronous.
+
Default: `false`.
batchTimeout::
  How long the producer will wait before sending in order to allow more messages to accumulate in the same batch.
(Normally the producer does not wait at all, and simply sends all the messages that accumulated while the previous send was in progress.) A non-zero value may increase throughput at the expense of latency.
+
Default: `0`.
messageKeyExpression::
 A SpEL expression evaluated against the outgoing message used to populate the key of the produced Kafka message.
For example `headers['myKey']`; the payload cannot be used because by the time this expression is evaluated, the payload is already in the form of a `byte[]`.
+
Default: `none`.
headerPatterns::
  A comma-delimited list of simple patterns to match spring-messaging headers to be mapped to the kafka `Headers` in the `ProducerRecord`.
Patterns can begin or end with the wildcard character (asterisk).
Patterns can be negated by prefixing with `!`; matching stops after the first match (positive or negative).
For example `!foo,fo*` will pass `fox` but not `foo`.
`id` and `timestamp` are never mapped.
+
Default: `*` (all headers - except the `id` and `timestamp`)
configuration::
  Map with a key/value pair containing generic Kafka producer properties.
+
Default: Empty map.

[NOTE]
====
The Kafka binder will use the `partitionCount` setting of the producer as a hint to create a topic with the given partition count (in conjunction with the `minPartitionCount`, the maximum of the two being the value being used).
Exercise caution when configuring both `minPartitionCount` for a binder and `partitionCount` for an application, as the larger value will be used.
If a topic already exists with a smaller partition count and `autoAddPartitions` is disabled (the default), then the binder will fail to start.
If a topic already exists with a smaller partition count and `autoAddPartitions` is enabled, new partitions will be added.
If a topic already exists with a larger number of partitions than the maximum of (`minPartitionCount` and `partitionCount`), the existing partition count will be used.
====

=== Usage examples

In this section, we illustrate the use of the above properties for specific scenarios.

==== Example: Setting `autoCommitOffset` false and relying on manual acking.

This example illustrates how one may manually acknowledge offsets in a consumer application.

This example requires that `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.input.consumer.autoCommitOffset` is set to false.
Use the corresponding input channel name for your example.

[source]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class ManuallyAcknowdledgingConsumer {

 public static void main(String[] args) {
     SpringApplication.run(ManuallyAcknowdledgingConsumer.class, args);
 }

 @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
 public void process(Message<?> message) {
     Acknowledgment acknowledgment = message.getHeaders().get(KafkaHeaders.ACKNOWLEDGMENT, Acknowledgment.class);
     if (acknowledgment != null) {
         System.out.println("Acknowledgment provided");
         acknowledgment.acknowledge();
     }
 }
}
----

==== Example: security configuration

Apache Kafka 0.9 supports secure connections between client and brokers.
To take advantage of this feature, follow the guidelines in the http://kafka.apache.org/090/documentation.html#security_configclients[Apache Kafka Documentation] as well as the Kafka 0.9 http://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/kafka/security.html[security guidelines from the Confluent documentation].
Use the `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration` option to set security properties for all clients created by the binder.

For example, for setting `security.protocol` to `SASL_SSL`, set:

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration.security.protocol=SASL_SSL
----

All the other security properties can be set in a similar manner.

When using Kerberos, follow the instructions in the http://kafka.apache.org/090/documentation.html#security_sasl_clientconfig[reference documentation] for creating and referencing the JAAS configuration.

Spring Cloud Stream supports passing JAAS configuration information to the application using a JAAS configuration file and using Spring Boot properties.

===== Using JAAS configuration files

The JAAS, and (optionally) krb5 file locations can be set for Spring Cloud Stream applications by using system properties.
Here is an example of launching a Spring Cloud Stream application with SASL and Kerberos using a JAAS configuration file:

[source]
----
 java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/path.to/kafka_client_jaas.conf -jar log.jar \
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers=secure.server:9092 \
   --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=stream.ticktock \
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration.security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
----

===== Using Spring Boot properties

As an alternative to having a JAAS configuration file, Spring Cloud Stream provides a mechanism for setting up the JAAS configuration for Spring Cloud Stream applications using Spring Boot properties.

The following properties can be used for configuring the login context of the Kafka client.

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.jaas.loginModule::
  The login module name. Not necessary to be set in normal cases.
+
Default: `com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.jaas.controlFlag::
  The control flag of the login module.
+
Default: `required`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.jaas.options::
  Map with a key/value pair containing the login module options.
+
Default: Empty map.

Here is an example of launching a Spring Cloud Stream application with SASL and Kerberos using Spring Boot configuration properties:

[source]
----
 java --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers=secure.server:9092 \
   --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=stream.ticktock \
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoCreateTopics=false \
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration.security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT \
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.jaas.options.useKeyTab=true \
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.jaas.options.storeKey=true \
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.jaas.options.keyTab=/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_client.keytab \
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.jaas.options.principal=kafka-client-1@EXAMPLE.COM
----

This represents the equivalent of the following JAAS file:

[source]
----
KafkaClient {
    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
    useKeyTab=true
    storeKey=true
    keyTab="/etc/security/keytabs/kafka_client.keytab"
    principal="kafka-client-1@EXAMPLE.COM";
};
----

If the topics required already exist on the broker, or will be created by an administrator, autocreation can be turned off and only client JAAS properties need to be sent.

[NOTE]
====
Do not mix JAAS configuration files and Spring Boot properties in the same application.
If the `-Djava.security.auth.login.config` system property is already present, Spring Cloud Stream will ignore the Spring Boot properties.

====

[NOTE]
====
Exercise caution when using the `autoCreateTopics` and `autoAddPartitions` if using Kerberos.
Usually applications may use principals that do not have administrative rights in Kafka and Zookeeper, and relying on Spring Cloud Stream to create/modify topics may fail.
In secure environments, we strongly recommend creating topics and managing ACLs administratively using Kafka tooling.
====

[[pause-resume]]
==== Example: Pausing and Resuming the Consumer

If you wish to suspend consumption, but not cause a partition rebalance, you can pause and resume the consumer.
This is facilitated by adding the `Consumer` as a parameter to your `@StreamListener`.
To resume, you need an `ApplicationListener` for `ListenerContainerIdleEvent` s; the frequency at which events are published is controlled by the `idleEventInterval` property.
Since the consumer is not thread-safe, you must call these methods on the calling thread.

The following simple application shows how to pause and resume.

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

	@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
	public void in(String in, @Header(KafkaHeaders.CONSUMER) Consumer<?, ?> consumer) {
		System.out.println(in);
		consumer.pause(Collections.singleton(new TopicPartition("myTopic", 0)));
	}

	@Bean
	public ApplicationListener<ListenerContainerIdleEvent> idleListener() {
		return event -> {
			System.out.println(event);
			if (event.getConsumer().paused().size() > 0) {
				event.getConsumer().resume(event.getConsumer().paused());
			}
		};
	}

}
----

[[kafka-error-channels]]
== Error Channels

Starting with _version 1.3_, the binder unconditionally sends exceptions to an error channel for each consumer destination, and can be configured to send async producer send failures to an error channel too.
See <<binder-error-channels>> for more information.

The payload of the `ErrorMessage` for a send failure is a `KafkaSendFailureException` with properties:

* `failedMessage` - the spring-messaging `Message<?>` that failed to be sent.
* `record` - the raw `ProducerRecord` that was created from the `failedMessage`

There is no automatic handling of producer exceptions (such as sending to a <<kafka-dlq-processing, Dead-Letter queue>>); you can consume these exceptions with your own Spring Integration flow.

[[kafka-metrics]]
== Kafka Metrics

Kafka binder module exposes the following metrics:

`spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.someGroup.someTopic.lag`  - this metric indicates how many messages have not been yet consumed from given binder's topic by given consumer group.
For example if the value of the metric `spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.myGroup.myTopic.lag` is `1000`, then consumer group `myGroup` has `1000` messages to waiting to be consumed from topic `myTopic`.
This metric is particularly useful to provide auto-scaling feedback to PaaS platform of your choice.
