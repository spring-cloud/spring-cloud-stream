This guide describes the Apache Kafka implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder.
It contains information about its design, usage and configuration options, as well as information on how the Stream Cloud Stream concepts map into Apache Kafka specific constructs.
--

== Usage

For using the Apache Kafka binder, you just need to add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, using the following Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can also use the Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Starter.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Apache Kafka Binder Overview

A simplified diagram of how the Apache Kafka binder operates can be seen below.

The Apache Kafka Binder implementation maps each destination to an Apache Kafka topic.
The consumer group maps directly to the same Apache Kafka concept.
Partitioning also maps directly to Apache Kafka partitions as well.

== Configuration Options

This section contains the configuration options used by the Apache Kafka binder.

For common configuration options and properties pertaining to binder, refer to the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-stream-overview.adoc#configuration-options[core docs].

=== Kafka Binder Properties

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers::
  A list of brokers to which the Kafka binder will connect.
+
Default: `localhost`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.defaultBrokerPort::
  `brokers` allows hosts specified with or without port information (e.g., `host1,host2:port2`).
This sets the default port when no port is configured in the broker list.
+
Default: `9092`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.zkNodes::
  A list of ZooKeeper nodes to which the Kafka binder can connect.
+
Default: `localhost`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.defaultZkPort::
  `zkNodes` allows hosts specified with or without port information (e.g., `host1,host2:port2`).
This sets the default port when no port is configured in the node list.
+
Default: `2181`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration::
  Key/Value map of client properties (both producers and consumer) passed to all clients created by the binder.
Due to the fact that these properties will be used by both producers and consumers, usage should be restricted to common properties, especially security settings.
+
Default: Empty map.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.headers::
  The list of custom headers that will be transported by the binder.
+
Default: empty.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.offsetUpdateTimeWindow::
  The frequency, in milliseconds, with which offsets are saved.
Ignored if `0`.
+
Default: `10000`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.offsetUpdateCount::
  The frequency, in number of updates, which which consumed offsets are persisted.
Ignored if `0`.
Mutually exclusive with `offsetUpdateTimeWindow`.
+
Default: `0`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.requiredAcks::
  The number of required acks on the broker.
+
Default: `1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.minPartitionCount::
  Effective only if `autoCreateTopics` or `autoAddPartitions` is set.
The global minimum number of partitions that the binder will configure on topics on which it produces/consumes data.
It can be superseded by the `partitionCount` setting of the producer or by the value of `instanceCount` * `concurrency` settings of the producer (if either is larger).
+
Default: `1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.replicationFactor::
  The replication factor of auto-created topics if `autoCreateTopics` is active.
+
Default: `1`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoCreateTopics::
  If set to `true`, the binder will create new topics automatically.
If set to `false`, the binder will rely on the topics being already configured.
In the latter case, if the topics do not exist, the binder will fail to start.
Of note, this setting is independent of the `auto.topic.create.enable` setting of the broker and it does not influence it: if the server is set to auto-create topics, they may be created as part of the metadata retrieval request, with default broker settings.
+
Default: `true`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoAddPartitions::
  If set to `true`, the binder will create add new partitions if required.
If set to `false`, the binder will rely on the partition size of the topic being already configured.
If the partition count of the target topic is smaller than the expected value, the binder will fail to start.
+
Default: `false`.
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.socketBufferSize::
  Size (in bytes) of the socket buffer to be used by the Kafka consumers.
+
Default: `2097152`.

=== Kafka Consumer Properties

The following properties are available for Kafka consumers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<channelName>.consumer.`.

autoRebalanceEnabled::
When `true`, topic partitions will be automatically rebalanced between the members of a consumer group.
When `false`, each consumer will be assigned a fixed set of partitions based on `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex`.
This requires both `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` properties to be set appropriately on each launched instance.
The property `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` must typically be greater than 1 in this case.
+
Default: `true`.
autoCommitOffset::
  Whether to autocommit offsets when a message has been processed.
If set to `false`, an `Acknowledgment` header will be available in the message headers for late acknowledgment.
+
Default: `true`.
autoCommitOnError::
  Effective only if `autoCommitOffset` is set to `true`.
If set to `false` it suppresses auto-commits for messages that result in errors, and will commit only for successful messages, allows a stream to automatically replay from the last successfully processed message, in case of persistent failures.
If set to `true`, it will always auto-commit (if auto-commit is enabled).
If not set (default), it effectively has the same value as `enableDlq`, auto-committing erroneous messages if they are sent to a DLQ, and not committing them otherwise.
+
Default: not set.
recoveryInterval::
  The interval between connection recovery attempts, in milliseconds.
+
Default: `5000`.
resetOffsets::
  Whether to reset offsets on the consumer to the value provided by `startOffset`.
+
Default: `false`.
startOffset::
  The starting offset for new groups, or when `resetOffsets` is `true`.
Allowed values: `earliest`, `latest`.
+
Default: null (equivalent to `earliest`).
enableDlq::
  When set to true, it will send enable DLQ behavior for the consumer.
  Messages that result in errors will be forwarded to a topic named `error.<destination>.<group>`.
  This provides an alternative option to the more common Kafka replay scenario for the case when the number of errors is relatively small and replaying the entire original topic may be too cumbersome.
+
Default: `false`.
configuration::
  Map with a key/value pair containing generic Kafka consumer properties.
+
Default: Empty map.

=== Kafka Producer Properties

The following properties are available for Kafka producers only and
must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.<channelName>.producer.`.

bufferSize::
  Upper limit, in bytes, of how much data the Kafka producer will attempt to batch before sending.
+
Default: `16384`.
sync::
  Whether the producer is synchronous.
+
Default: `false`.
batchTimeout::
  How long the producer will wait before sending in order to allow more messages to accumulate in the same batch.
(Normally the producer does not wait at all, and simply sends all the messages that accumulated while the previous send was in progress.) A non-zero value may increase throughput at the expense of latency.
+
Default: `0`.
configuration::
  Map with a key/value pair containing generic Kafka producer properties.
+
Default: Empty map.

[NOTE]
====
The Kafka binder will use the `partitionCount` setting of the producer as a hint to create a topic with the given partition count (in conjunction with the `minPartitionCount`, the maximum of the two being the value being used).
Exercise caution when configuring both `minPartitionCount` for a binder and `partitionCount` for an application, as the larger value will be used.
If a topic already exists with a smaller partition count and `autoAddPartitions` is disabled (the default), then the binder will fail to start.
If a topic already exists with a smaller partition count and `autoAddPartitions` is enabled, new partitions will be added.
If a topic already exists with a larger number of partitions than the maximum of (`minPartitionCount` and `partitionCount`), the existing partition count will be used.
====

=== Usage examples

In this section, we illustrate the use of the above properties for specific scenarios.

==== Example: security configuration

Apache Kafka 0.9 supports secure connections between client and brokers.
To take advantage of this feature, follow the guidelines in the http://kafka.apache.org/090/documentation.html#security_configclients[Apache Kafka Documentation] as well as the Kafka 0.9 http://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/kafka/security.html[security guidelines from the Confluent documentation].
Use the `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration` option to set security properties for all clients created by the binder.

For example, for setting `security.protocol` to `SASL_SSL`, set:

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration.security.protocol=SASL_SSL
----

All the other security properties can be set in a similar manner.

When using Kerberos, follow the instructions in the http://kafka.apache.org/090/documentation.html#security_sasl_clientconfig[reference documentation] for creating and referencing the JAAS configuration.
At the time of this release, the JAAS, and (optionally) krb5 file locations must be set for Spring Cloud Stream applications by using system properties.
Here is an example of launching a Spring Cloud Stream application with SASL and Kerberos.

[source]
----
 java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=/path.to/kafka_client_jaas.conf -jar log.jar \\
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers=secure.server:9092 \\
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.zkNodes=secure.zookeeper:2181 \\
   --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=stream.ticktock \\
   --spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.clientConfiguration.security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
----


[NOTE]
====
Exercise caution when using the `autoCreateTopics` and `autoAddPartitions` if using Kerberos.
Usually applications may use principals that do not have administrative rights in Kafka and Zookeeper, and relying on Spring Cloud Stream to create/modify topics may fail.
In secure environments, we strongly recommend creating topics and managing ACLs administratively using Kafka tooling.
====

==== Using the binder with Apache Kafka 0.10

The binder also supports connecting to Kafka 0.10 brokers.
In order to support this, when you create the project that contains your application, include `spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka` as you normally would do for 0.9 based applications.
Then add these dependencies at the top of the `<dependencies>` section in the pom.xml file to override the Apache Kafka, Spring Kafka, and Spring Integration Kafka with 0.10-compatible versions as in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-kafka</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0.M1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-integration-kafka</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.1.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
  <artifactId>kafka_2.11</artifactId>
  <version>0.10.0.0</version>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
The versions above are provided only for the sake of the example.
For best results, we recommend using the most recent 0.10-compatible versions of the projects.
====

==== Excluding Kafka broker jar from the classpath of the binder based application
If the inclusion of the Kafka broker is not desired at runtime, Kafka binder allows this particular dependency to be excluded from the binder so that it will not be part of the classpath.
However, topic creation will be disabled from the binder if this dependency is excluded.

If you use Kafka 10 dependencies as advised above, all you have to do is not to include the kafka broker dependency.
If you use Kafka 0.9, then ensure that you exclude the kafka broker jar from the `spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka` dependency as following.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka</artifactId>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
      <artifactId>kafka_2.11</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions>
</dependency>
----

If you exclude the kafka broker dependency and the topic is not present on the server, then Kafka broker will create the topic if auto topic creation is enabled on the server.
Please keep in mind that if you are relying on this, then the Kafka server will use the default number of partitions and replication factors.
On the other hand, if auto topic creation is disabled on the server, then care must be taken before running the application to create the topic with the desired number of partitions.

If you want to have full control over how partitions are allocated, then leave the default settings as they are, i.e. do not exclude the kafka broker jar and ensure that `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.autoCreateTopics` is set to `true` which is the default.
