= Consuming Records

In the above `uppercase` function, we are consuming the record as `Flux<String>` and then produce it as `Flux<String>`.
There might be occasions in which you need to receive the record in the original received format - the `ReceiverRecord`.
Here is such a function.

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Function<Flux<ReceiverRecord<byte[], byte[]>>, Flux<String>> lowercase() {
    return s -> s.map(rec -> new String(rec.value()).toLowerCase());
}
----

In this function, note that, we are consuming the record as `Flux<ReceiverRecord<byte[], byte[]>>` and then producing it as `Flux<String>`.
`ReceiverRecord` is the basic received record which is a specialized Kafka `ConsumerRecord` in Reactor Kafka.
When using the reactive Kafka binder, the above function will give you access to the `ReceiverRecord` type for each incoming record.
However, in this case, you need to provide a custom implementation for a https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/current/api/org/springframework/kafka/support/converter/RecordMessageConverter.html[RecordMessageConverter].
By default, the reactive Kafka binder uses a https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/current/api/org/springframework/kafka/support/converter/MessagingMessageConverter.html[MessagingMessageConverter] that converts the payload and headers from the `ConsumerRecord`.
Therefore, by the time your handler method receives it, the payload is already extracted from the received record and passed onto the method as in the case of the first function we looked above.
By providing a custom `RecordMessageConverter` implementation in the application, you can override the default behavior.
For example, if you want to consume the record as raw `Flux<ReceiverRecord<byte[], byte[]>>`, then you can provide the following bean definition in the application.

[source, java]
----
@Bean
RecordMessageConverter fullRawReceivedRecord() {
    return new RecordMessageConverter() {

        private final RecordMessageConverter converter = new MessagingMessageConverter();

        @Override
        public Message<?> toMessage(ConsumerRecord<?, ?> record, Acknowledgment acknowledgment,
                Consumer<?, ?> consumer, Type payloadType) {
            return MessageBuilder.withPayload(record).build();
        }

        @Override
        public ProducerRecord<?, ?> fromMessage(Message<?> message, String defaultTopic) {
            return this.converter.fromMessage(message, defaultTopic);
        }

    };
}
----

Then, you need to instruct the framework to use this converter for the required binding.
Here is an example based on our `lowercase` function.

```
spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings.lowercase-in-0.consumer.converterBeanName=fullRawReceivedRecord"
```

`lowercase-in-0` is the input binding name for our `lowercase` function.
For the outbound (`lowercase-out-0`), we still use the regular `MessagingMessageConverter`.

In the `toMessage` implementation above, we receive the raw `ConsumerRecord` (`ReceiverRecord` since we are in a reactive binder context) and then wrap it inside a `Message`.
Then that message payload which is the `ReceiverRecord` is provided to the user method.

If `reactiveAutoCommit` is `false` (default), call `rec.receiverOffset().acknowledge()` (or `commit()`) to cause the offset to be committed; if `reactiveAutoCommit` is `true`, the flux supplies `ConsumerRecord` s instead.
Refer to the `reactor-kafka` documentation and javadocs for more information.
