== Introducing Spring Cloud Stream

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications.
Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers.
It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.

You can add the `@EnableBinding` annotation to your application to get immediate connectivity to a message broker, and you can add `@StreamListener` to a method to cause it to receive events for stream processing.
The following example shows a sink application that receives external messages:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class VoteRecordingSinkApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(VoteRecordingSinkApplication.class, args);
  }

  @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
  public void processVote(Vote vote) {
      votingService.recordVote(vote);
  }
}
----

The `@EnableBinding` annotation takes one or more interfaces as parameters (in this case, the parameter is a single `Sink` interface).
An interface declares input and output channels.
Spring Cloud Stream provides the `Source`, `Sink`, and `Processor` interfaces. You can also define your own interfaces.

The following listing shows the definition of the `Sink` interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface Sink {
  String INPUT = "input";

  @Input(Sink.INPUT)
  SubscribableChannel input();
}
----

The `@Input` annotation identifies an input channel, through which received messages enter the application.
The `@Output` annotation identifies an output channel, through which published messages leave the application.
The `@Input` and `@Output` annotations can take a channel name as a parameter.
If a name is not provided, the name of the annotated method is used.

Spring Cloud Stream creates an implementation of the interface for you.
You can use this in the application by autowiring it, as shown in the following example (from a test case):

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = VoteRecordingSinkApplication.class)
@WebAppConfiguration
@DirtiesContext
public class StreamApplicationTests {

  @Autowired
  private Sink sink;

  @Test
  public void contextLoads() {
    assertThat(this.sink.input()).isNotNull();
  }
}
----

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-application-model]]
=== Application Model

A Spring Cloud Stream application consists of a middleware-neutral core.
The application communicates with the outside world through input and output channels injected into it by Spring Cloud Stream.
Channels are connected to external brokers through middleware-specific Binder implementations.

.Spring Cloud Stream Application

==== Fat JAR

Spring Cloud Stream applications can be run in stand-alone mode from your IDE for testing.
To run a Spring Cloud Stream application in production, you can create an executable (or "`fat`") JAR by using the standard Spring Boot tooling provided for Maven or Gradle. See the  https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-build.html#howto-create-an-executable-jar-with-maven[Spring Boot Reference Guide] for more details.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-binder-abstraction]]
=== The Binder Abstraction

Spring Cloud Stream provides Binder implementations for https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka[Kafka] and https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit[Rabbit MQ].
Spring Cloud Stream also includes a https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-test-support/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/test/binder/TestSupportBinder.java[TestSupportBinder], which leaves a channel unmodified so that tests can interact with channels directly and reliably assert on what is received.
You can also use the extensible API to write your own Binder.

Spring Cloud Stream uses Spring Boot for configuration, and the Binder abstraction makes it possible for a Spring Cloud Stream application to be flexible in how it connects to middleware.
For example, deployers can dynamically choose, at runtime, the destinations (such as the Kafka topics or RabbitMQ exchanges) to which channels connect.
Such configuration can be provided through external configuration properties and in any form supported by Spring Boot (including application arguments, environment variables, and `application.yml` or `application.properties` files).
In the sink example from the <<spring-cloud-stream-overview-introducing>> section, setting the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination` application property to `raw-sensor-data` causes it to read from the `raw-sensor-data` Kafka topic or from a queue bound to the `raw-sensor-data` RabbitMQ exchange.

Spring Cloud Stream automatically detects and uses a binder found on the classpath.
You can use different types of middleware with the same code.
To do so, include a different binder at build time.
For more complex use cases, you can also package multiple binders with your application and have it choose the binder( and even whether to use different binders for different channels) at runtime.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-persistent-publish-subscribe-support]]
=== Persistent Publish-Subscribe Support

Communication between applications follows a publish-subscribe model, where data is broadcast through shared topics.
This can be seen in the following figure, which shows a typical deployment for a set of interacting Spring Cloud Stream applications.

.Spring Cloud Stream Publish-Subscribe
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/SCSt-sensors.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

Data reported by sensors to an HTTP endpoint is sent to a common destination named `raw-sensor-data`.
From the destination, it is independently processed by a microservice application that computes time-windowed averages and by another microservice application that ingests the raw data into HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
In order to process the data, both applications declare the topic as their input at runtime.

The publish-subscribe communication model reduces the complexity of both the producer and the consumer and lets new applications be added to the topology without disruption of the existing flow.
For example, downstream from the average-calculating application, you can add an application that calculates the highest temperature values for display and monitoring.
You can then add another application that interprets the same flow of averages for fault detection.
Doing all communication through shared topics rather than point-to-point queues reduces coupling between microservices.

While the concept of publish-subscribe messaging is not new, Spring Cloud Stream takes the extra step of making it an opinionated choice for its application model.
By using native middleware support, Spring Cloud Stream also simplifies use of the publish-subscribe model across different platforms.

[[consumer-groups]]
=== Consumer Groups
While the publish-subscribe model makes it easy to connect applications through shared topics, the ability to scale up by creating multiple instances of a given application is equally important.
When doing so, different instances of an application are placed in a competing consumer relationship, where only one of the instances is expected to handle a given message.

Spring Cloud Stream models this behavior through the concept of a consumer group.
(Spring Cloud Stream consumer groups are similar to and inspired by Kafka consumer groups.)
Each consumer binding can use the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.group` property to specify a group name.
For the consumers shown in the following figure, this property would be set as `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.group=hdfsWrite` or `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.group=average`.

.Spring Cloud Stream Consumer Groups
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/SCSt-groups.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

All groups that subscribe to a given destination receive a copy of published data, but only one member of each group receives a given message from that destination.
By default, when a group is not specified, Spring Cloud Stream assigns the application to an anonymous and independent single-member consumer group that is in a publish-subscribe relationship with all other consumer groups.

[[consumer-types]]
=== Consumer Types

Two types of consumer are supported:

* Message-driven (sometimes referred to as Asynchronous)
* Polled (sometimes referred to as Synchronous)

Prior to version 2.0, only asynchronous consumers were supported. A message is delivered as soon as it is available and a thread is available to process it.

When you wish to control the rate at which messages are processed, you might want to use a synchronous consumer.
// TODO This needs more description. A sentence parallel to the last sentence of the preceding paragraph would help.

[[durability]]
==== Durability

Consistent with the opinionated application model of Spring Cloud Stream, consumer group subscriptions are durable.
That is, a binder implementation ensures that group subscriptions are persistent and that, once at least one subscription for a group has been created, the group receives messages, even if they are sent while all applications in the group are stopped.

[NOTE]
====
Anonymous subscriptions are non-durable by nature.
For some binder implementations (such as RabbitMQ), it is possible to have non-durable group subscriptions.
====

In general, it is preferable to always specify a consumer group when binding an application to a given destination.
When scaling up a Spring Cloud Stream application, you must specify a consumer group for each of its input bindings.
Doing so prevents the application's instances from receiving duplicate messages (unless that behavior is desired, which is unusual).

[[partitioning]]
=== Partitioning Support

Spring Cloud Stream provides support for partitioning data between multiple instances of a given application.
In a partitioned scenario, the physical communication medium (such as the broker topic) is viewed as being structured into multiple partitions.
One or more producer application instances send data to multiple consumer application instances and ensure that data identified by common characteristics are processed by the same consumer instance.

Spring Cloud Stream provides a common abstraction for implementing partitioned processing use cases in a uniform fashion.
Partitioning can thus be used whether the broker itself is naturally partitioned (for example, Kafka) or not (for example, RabbitMQ).

.Spring Cloud Stream Partitioning
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/SCSt-partitioning.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

Partitioning is a critical concept in stateful processing, where it is critical (for either performance or consistency reasons) to ensure that all related data is processed together.
For example, in the time-windowed average calculation example, it is important that all measurements from any given sensor are processed by the same application instance.

NOTE: To set up a partitioned processing scenario, you must configure both the data-producing and the data-consuming ends.

== Programming Model

To understand the programming model, you should be familiar with the following core concepts:

* *Destination Binders:* Components responsible to provide integration with the external messaging systems.
* *Destination Bindings:* Bridge between the external messaging systems and application provided _Producers_ and _Consumers_ of messages (created by the Destination Binders).
* *Message:* The canonical data structure used by producers and consumers to communicate with Destination Binders (and thus other applications via external messaging systems).

image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/SCSt-overview.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

=== Destination Binders

Destination Binders are extension components of Spring Cloud Stream responsible for providing the necessary configuration and implementation to facilitate
integration with external messaging systems.
This integration is responsible for connectivity, delegation, and routing of messages to and from producers and consumers, data type conversion,
invocation of the user code, and more.

Binders handle a lot of the boiler plate responsibilities that would otherwise fall on your shoulders. However, to accomplish that, the binder still needs
some help in the form of minimalistic yet required set of instructions from the user, which typically come in the form of some type of configuration.

While it is out of scope of this section to discuss all of the available binder and binding configuration options (the rest of the manual covers them extensively),
_Destination Binding_ does require special attention. The next section discusses it in detail.

=== Destination Bindings

As stated earlier, _Destination Bindings_ provide a bridge between the external messaging system and application-provided _Producers_ and _Consumers_.

Applying the @EnableBinding annotation to one of the application’s configuration classes defines a destination binding.
The `@EnableBinding` annotation itself is meta-annotated with `@Configuration` and triggers the configuration of the Spring Cloud Stream infrastructure.

The following example shows a fully configured and functioning Spring Cloud Stream application that receives the payload of the message from the `INPUT`
destination as a `String` type (see <<Content Type Negotiation>> section), logs it to the console and sends it to the `OUTPUT` destination after converting it to upper case.

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class MyApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
	}

	@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
	@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
	public String handle(String value) {
		System.out.println("Received: " + value);
		return value.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----

As you can see the `@EnableBinding` annotation can take one or more interface classes as parameters. The parameters are referred to as _bindings_,
and they contain methods representing _bindable components_.
These components are typically message channels (see https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-messaging.html[Spring Messaging])
for channel-based binders (such as Rabbit, Kafka, and others). However other types of bindings can
provide support for the native features of the corresponding technology. For example Kafka Streams binder (formerly known as KStream) allows native bindings directly to Kafka Streams
(see http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/{spring-cloud-stream-version}/[Kafka Binder] for more details).

Spring Cloud Stream already provides _binding_ interfaces for typical message exchange contracts, which include:

* *Sink:* Identifies the contract for the message consumer by providing the destination from which the message is consumed.
* *Source:* Identifies the contract for the message producer by providing the destination to which the produced message is sent.
* *Processor:* Encapsulates both the sink and the source contracts by exposing two destinations that allow consumption and production of messages.

[source, java]
----
public interface Sink {

  String INPUT = "input";

  @Input(Sink.INPUT)
  SubscribableChannel input();
}
----

[source, java]
----
public interface Source {

  String OUTPUT = "output";

  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  MessageChannel output();
}
----

[source, java]
----
public interface Processor extends Source, Sink {}
----

While the preceding example satisfies the majority of cases, you can also define your own contracts by defining your own bindings interfaces and use `@Input` and `@Output`
annotations to identify the actual _bindable components_.

For example:

[source, java]
----
public interface Barista {

    @Input
    SubscribableChannel orders();

    @Output
    MessageChannel hotDrinks();

    @Output
    MessageChannel coldDrinks();
}
----

Using the interface shown in the preceding example as a parameter to `@EnableBinding` triggers the creation of the three bound channels named `orders`, `hotDrinks`, and `coldDrinks`,
respectively.

You can provide as many binding interfaces as you need, as arguments to the `@EnableBinding` annotation, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
@EnableBinding(value = { Orders.class, Payment.class })
----

In Spring Cloud Stream, the bindable `MessageChannel` components are the Spring Messaging `MessageChannel` (for outbound) and its extension, `SubscribableChannel`,
(for inbound).

*Pollable Destination Binding*

While the previously described bindings support event-based message consumption, sometimes you need more control, such as rate of consumption.

Starting with version 2.0, you can now bind a pollable consumer:

The following example shows how to bind a pollable consumer:

[source, java]
----
public interface PolledBarista {

    @Input
    PollableMessageSource orders();
	. . .
}
----

In this case, an implementation of `PollableMessageSource` is bound to the `orders` “channel”. See <<Using Polled Consumers>> for more details.

*Customizing Channel Names*

By using the `@Input` and `@Output` annotations, you can specify a customized channel name for the channel, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
public interface Barista {
    @Input("inboundOrders")
    SubscribableChannel orders();
}
----

In the preceding example, the created bound channel is named `inboundOrders`.

Normally, you need not access individual channels or bindings directly  (other then configuring them via `@EnableBinding` annotation). However there may be
times, such as testing or other corner cases, when you do.

Aside from generating channels for each binding and registering them as Spring beans, for each bound interface, Spring Cloud Stream generates a bean that implements the interface.
That means you can have access to the interfaces representing the bindings or individual channels by auto-wiring either in your application, as shown in the following two examples:

_Autowire Binding interface_

[source, java]
----
@Autowire
private Source source

public void sayHello(String name) {
    source.output().send(MessageBuilder.withPayload(name).build());
}
----

_Autowire individual channel_

[source, java]
----
@Autowire
private MessageChannel output;

public void sayHello(String name) {
    output.send(MessageBuilder.withPayload(name).build());
}
----

You can also use standard Spring's `@Qualifier` annotation for cases when channel names are customized or in multiple-channel scenarios that require specifically named channels.

The following example shows how to use the @Qualifier annotation in this way:

[source, java]
----
@Autowire
@Qualifier("myChannel")
private MessageChannel output;
----

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-producing-consuming-messages]]
=== Producing and Consuming Messages

You can write a Spring Cloud Stream application by using either Spring Integration annotations or Spring Cloud Stream native annotation.

==== Spring Integration Support

Spring Cloud Stream is built on the concepts and patterns defined by http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/[Enterprise Integration Patterns] and relies
in its internal implementation on an already established and popular implementation of Enterprise Integration Patterns within the Spring portfolio of projects:
https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/[Spring Integration] framework.

So its only natural for it to support the foundation, semantics, and configuration options that are already established by Spring Integration

For example, you can attach the output channel of a `Source` to a `MessageSource` and use the familiar `@InboundChannelAdapter` annotation, as follows:

[source, java]
----
@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class TimerSource {

  @Bean
  @InboundChannelAdapter(value = Source.OUTPUT, poller = @Poller(fixedDelay = "10", maxMessagesPerPoll = "1"))
  public MessageSource<String> timerMessageSource() {
    return () -> new GenericMessage<>("Hello Spring Cloud Stream");
  }
}
----

Similarly, you can use @Transformer or @ServiceActivator while providing an implementation of a message handler method for a _Processor_ binding contract, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class TransformProcessor {
  @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
  public Object transform(String message) {
    return message.toUpperCase();
  }
}
----

NOTE: While this may be skipping ahead a bit, it is important to understand that, when you consume from the same binding using `@StreamListener` annotation, a pub-sub model is used.
Each method annotated with `@StreamListener` receives its own copy of a message, and each one has its own consumer group.
However, if you consume from the same binding by using one of the Spring Integration annotation (such as `@Aggregator`, `@Transformer`, or `@ServiceActivator`), those consume in a competing model.
No individual consumer group is created for each subscription.

==== Using @StreamListener Annotation

Complementary to its Spring Integration support, Spring Cloud Stream provides its own `@StreamListener` annotation, modeled after other Spring Messaging annotations
(`@MessageMapping`, `@JmsListener`, `@RabbitListener`, and others) and provides conviniences, such as content-based routing and others.

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class VoteHandler {

  @Autowired
  VotingService votingService;

  @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
  public void handle(Vote vote) {
    votingService.record(vote);
  }
}
----

As with other Spring Messaging methods, method arguments can be annotated with `@Payload`, `@Headers`, and `@Header`.


For methods that return data, you must use the `@SendTo` annotation to specify the output binding destination for data returned by the method, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class TransformProcessor {

  @Autowired
  VotingService votingService;

  @StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
  @SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
  public VoteResult handle(Vote vote) {
    return votingService.record(vote);
  }
}
----


==== Using @StreamListener for Content-based routing

Spring Cloud Stream supports dispatching messages to multiple handler methods annotated with `@StreamListener` based on conditions.

In order to be eligible to support conditional dispatching, a method must satisfy the follow conditions:

* It must not return a value.
* It must be an individual message handling method (reactive API methods are not supported).

The condition is specified by a SpEL expression in the `condition` argument of the annotation and is evaluated for each message.
All the handlers that match the condition are invoked in the same thread, and no assumption must be made about the order in which the invocations take place.

In the following example of a `@StreamListener` with dispatching conditions, all the messages bearing a header `type` with the value `bogey` are dispatched to the
`receiveBogey` method, and all the messages bearing a header `type` with the value `bacall` are dispatched to the `receiveBacall` method.

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class TestPojoWithAnnotatedArguments {

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "headers['type']=='bogey'")
    public void receiveBogey(@Payload BogeyPojo bogeyPojo) {
       // handle the message
    }

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "headers['type']=='bacall'")
    public void receiveBacall(@Payload BacallPojo bacallPojo) {
       // handle the message
    }
}
----

*Content Type Negotiation in the Context of `condition`*

It is important to understand some of the mechanics behind content-based routing using the `condition` argument of `@StreamListener`, especially in the context of the type of the message as a whole.
It may also help if you familiarize yourself with the <<Content Type Negotiation>>  before you proceed.

Consider the following scenario:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class CatsAndDogs {

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "payload.class.simpleName=='Dog'")
    public void bark(Dog dog) {
       // handle the message
    }

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "payload.class.simpleName=='Cat'")
    public void purr(Cat cat) {
       // handle the message
    }
}
----

The preceding code is perfectly valid. It compiles and deploys without any issues, yet it never produces the result you expect.

That is because you are testing something that does not yet exist in a state you expect. That is because the payload of the message is not yet converted from the
wire format (`byte[]`) to the desired type.
In other words, it has not yet gone through the type conversion process described in the <<Content Type Negotiation>>.

So, unless you use a SPeL expression that evaluates raw data (for example, the value of the first byte in the byte array), use message header-based expressions
(such as `condition = "headers['type']=='dog'"`).


NOTE: At the moment, dispatching through `@StreamListener` conditions is supported only for channel-based binders (not for reactive programming)
support.


[[spring_cloud_function]]
==== Spring Cloud Function support

Since Spring Cloud Stream v2.1, another alternative for defining _stream handlers_ and _sources_ is to use build-in
support for https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/[Spring Cloud Function] where they can be expressed as beans of
 type `java.util.function.[Supplier/Function/Consumer]`.

To specify which functional bean to bind to the external destination(s) exposed by the bindings, you must provide `spring.cloud.stream.function.definition` property.

Here is the example of the Processor application exposing message handler as `java.util.function.Function`
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class MyFunctionBootApp {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(MyFunctionBootApp.class, "--spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=toUpperCase");
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> toUpperCase() {
		return s -> s.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----
In the above you we simply define a bean of type `java.util.function.Function` called _toUpperCase_ and identify it as a bean to be used as message handler
whose 'input' and 'output' must be bound to the external destinations exposed by the Processor binding.

Below are the examples of simple functional applications to support Source, Processor and Sink.

Here is the example of a Source application defined as `java.util.function.Supplier`
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public static class SourceFromSupplier {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SourceFromSupplier.class, "--spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=date");
	}
	@Bean
	public Supplier<Date> date() {
		return () -> new Date(12345L);
	}
}
----

Here is the example of a Processor application defined as `java.util.function.Function`
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public static class ProcessorFromFunction {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(ProcessorFromFunction.class, "--spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=toUpperCase");
	}
	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> toUpperCase() {
		return s -> s.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----

Here is the example of a Sink application defined as `java.util.function.Consumer`
[source,java]
----
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public static class SinkFromConsumer {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SinkFromConsumer.class, "--spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=sink");
	}
	@Bean
	public Consumer<String> sink() {
		return System.out::println;
	}
}
----
===== Reactive Functions support

Since _Spring Cloud Function_ is build on top of https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor] there isn't much you need to do
to benefit from reactive programming model while implementing `Supplier`, `Function` or `Consumer`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public static class SinkFromConsumer {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SinkFromConsumer.class, "--spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=reactiveUpperCase");
	}
	@Bean
	public Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> reactiveUpperCase() {
		return flux -> flux.map(val -> val.toUpperCase());
	}
}
----
===== Functional Composition

Using this programming model you can also benefit from functional composition where you can dynamically compose complex handlers from a set of simple functions.
As an example let's add the following function bean to the application defined above
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Function<String, String> wrapInQuotes() {
	return s -> "\"" + s + "\"";
}
----
and modify the `spring.cloud.stream.function.definition` property to reflect your intention to compose a new function from both ‘toUpperCase’ and ‘wrapInQuotes’.
To do that Spring Cloud Function allows you to use `|` (pipe) symbol. So to finish our example our property will now look like this:

[source,java]
----
--spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=toUpperCase|wrapInQuotes
----

NOTE: One of the great benefits of functional composition support provided by _Spring Cloud Function_ is
the fact that you can compose _reactive_ and _imperative_ functions.

For example, the above composition could be defined as such (if both functions present):

[source,java]
----
--spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=reactiveUpperCase|wrapInQuotes
----



[[spring-cloud-streams-overview-using-polled-consumers]]
==== Using Polled Consumers

===== Overview

When using polled consumers, you poll the `PollableMessageSource` on demand.
Consider the following example of a polled consumer:

[source,java]
----
public interface PolledConsumer {

    @Input
    PollableMessageSource destIn();

    @Output
    MessageChannel destOut();

}
----

Given the polled consumer in the preceding example, you might use it as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource destIn, MessageChannel destOut) {
    return args -> {
        while (someCondition()) {
            try {
                if (!destIn.poll(m -> {
                    String newPayload = ((String) m.getPayload()).toUpperCase();
                    destOut.send(new GenericMessage<>(newPayload));
                })) {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                }
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                // handle failure
            }
        }
    };
}
----

A less manual and more Spring-like alternative would be to configure a scheduled task bean. For example,

[source,java]
----

@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5_000)
public void poll() {
	System.out.println("Polling...");
	this.source.poll(m -> {
		System.out.println(m.getPayload());

	}, new ParameterizedTypeReference<Foo>() { });
}
----


The `PollableMessageSource.poll()` method takes a `MessageHandler` argument (often a lambda expression, as shown here).
It returns `true` if the message was received and successfully processed.

As with message-driven consumers, if the `MessageHandler` throws an exception, messages are published to error channels,
as discussed in `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling>>`.

Normally, the `poll()` method acknowledges the message when the `MessageHandler` exits.
If the method exits abnormally, the message is rejected (not re-queued), but see <<polled-errors>>.
You can override that behavior by taking responsibility for the acknowledgment, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource dest1In, MessageChannel dest2Out) {
    return args -> {
        while (someCondition()) {
            if (!dest1In.poll(m -> {
                StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(m).noAutoAck();
                // e.g. hand off to another thread which can perform the ack
                // or acknowledge(Status.REQUEUE)

            })) {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }
        }
    };
}
----

IMPORTANT: You must `ack` (or `nack`) the message at some point, to avoid resource leaks.

IMPORTANT: Some messaging systems (such as Apache Kafka) maintain a simple offset in a log. If a delivery fails and is re-queued with  `StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(m).acknowledge(Status.REQUEUE);`, any later successfully ack'd messages are redelivered.

There is also an overloaded `poll` method, for which the definition is as follows:

[source,java]
----
poll(MessageHandler handler, ParameterizedTypeReference<?> type)
----

The `type` is a conversion hint that allows the incoming message payload to be converted, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
boolean result = pollableSource.poll(received -> {
			Map<String, Foo> payload = (Map<String, Foo>) received.getPayload();
            ...

		}, new ParameterizedTypeReference<Map<String, Foo>>() {});
----

[[polled-errors]]
===== Handling Errors

By default, an error channel is configured for the pollable source; if the callback throws an exception, an `ErrorMessage` is sent to the error channel (`<destination>.<group>.errors`); this error channel is also bridged to the global Spring Integration `errorChannel`.

You can subscribe to either error channel with a `@ServiceActivator` to handle errors; without a subscription, the error will simply be logged and the message will be acknowledged as successful.
If the error channel service activator throws an exception, the message will be rejected (by default) and won't be redelivered.
If the service activator throws a `RequeueCurrentMessageException`, the message will be requeued at the broker and will be again retrieved on a subsequent poll.

If the listener throws a `RequeueCurrentMessageException` directly, the message will be requeued, as discussed above, and will not be sent to the error channels.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling]]
=== Error Handling

Errors happen, and Spring Cloud Stream provides several flexible mechanisms to handle them.
The error handling comes in two flavors:

  * *application:* The error handling is done within the application (custom error handler).

  * *system:* The error handling is delegated to the binder (re-queue, DL, and others). Note that the techniques are dependent on binder implementation and the
  capability of the underlying messaging middleware.

Spring Cloud Stream uses the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] library to facilitate successful message processing. See <<Retry Template>> for more details.
However, when all fails, the exceptions thrown by the message handlers are propagated back to the binder. At that point, binder invokes custom error handler or communicates
the error back to the messaging system (re-queue, DLQ, and others).

==== Application Error Handling

There are two types of application-level error handling. Errors can be handled at each binding subscription or a global handler can handle all the binding subscription errors. Let's review the details.

.A Spring Cloud Stream Sink Application with Custom and Global Error Handlers
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/custom_vs_global_error_channels.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

For each input binding, Spring Cloud Stream creates a dedicated error channel with the following semantics `<destinationName>.errors`.

NOTE: The `<destinationName>` consists of the name of the binding (such as `input`) and the name of the group (such as `myGroup`).

Consider the following:

[source,text]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=myGroup
----

[source,java]
----
@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT) // destination name 'input.myGroup'
public void handle(Person value) {
	throw new RuntimeException("BOOM!");
}

@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT + ".myGroup.errors") //channel name 'input.myGroup.errors'
public void error(Message<?> message) {
	System.out.println("Handling ERROR: " + message);
}
----

In the preceding example the destination name is `input.myGroup` and the dedicated error channel name is `input.myGroup.errors`.

NOTE: The use of @StreamListener annotation is intended specifically to define bindings that bridge internal channels and external destinations. Given that the destination
specific error channel does NOT have an associated external destination, such channel is a prerogative of Spring Integration (SI). This means that the handler
for such destination must be defined using one of the SI handler annotations (i.e., @ServiceActivator, @Transformer etc.).

NOTE: If `group` is not specified anonymous group is used (something like `input.anonymous.2K37rb06Q6m2r51-SPIDDQ`), which is not suitable for error
handling scenarious, since you don't know what it's going to be until the destination is created.

Also, in the event you are binding to the existing destination such as:

[source,text]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=myFooDestination
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=myGroup
----

the full destination name is `myFooDestination.myGroup` and then the dedicated error channel name is `myFooDestination.myGroup.errors`.

Back to the example...

The `handle(..)` method, which subscribes to the channel named `input`, throws an exception.  Given there is also a subscriber to the error channel `input.myGroup.errors`
all error messages are handled by this subscriber.

If you have multiple bindings, you may want to have a single error handler. Spring Cloud Stream automatically provides support for
a _global error channel_ by bridging each individual error channel to the channel named `errorChannel`, allowing a single subscriber to handle all errors,
as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@StreamListener("errorChannel")
public void error(Message<?> message) {
	System.out.println("Handling ERROR: " + message);
}
----

This may be a convenient option if error handling logic is the same regardless of which handler produced the error.

==== System Error Handling

System-level error handling implies that the errors are communicated back to the messaging system and, given that not every messaging system
is the same, the capabilities may differ from binder to binder.

That said, in this section we explain the general idea behind system level error handling and use Rabbit binder as an example. NOTE: Kafka binder provides similar
support, although some configuration properties do differ. Also, for more details and configuration options, see the individual binder's documentation.

If no internal error handlers are configured, the errors propagate to the binders, and the binders subsequently propagate those errors back to the messaging system.
Depending on the capabilities of the messaging system such a system may _drop_ the message, _re-queue_ the message for re-processing or _send the failed message to DLQ_.
Both Rabbit and Kafka support these concepts. However, other binders may not, so refer to your individual binder’s documentation for details on supported system-level
error-handling options.

===== Drop Failed Messages

By default, if no additional system-level configuration is provided, the messaging system drops the failed message.
While acceptable in some cases, for most cases, it is not, and we need some recovery mechanism to avoid message loss.

===== DLQ - Dead Letter Queue

DLQ allows failed messages to be sent to a special destination: - _Dead Letter Queue_.

When configured, failed messages are sent to this destination for subsequent re-processing or auditing and reconciliation.

For example, continuing on the previous example and to set up the DLQ with Rabbit binder, you need to set the following property:

[source,text]
----
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.auto-bind-dlq=true
----

Keep in mind that, in the above property, `input` corresponds to the name of the input destination binding.
The `consumer` indicates that it is a consumer property and `auto-bind-dlq` instructs the binder to configure DLQ for `input`
destination, which results in an additional Rabbit queue named `input.myGroup.dlq`.

Once configured, all failed messages are routed to this queue with an error message similar to the following:

[source,text]
----
delivery_mode:	1
headers:
x-death:
count:	1
reason:	rejected
queue:	input.hello
time:	1522328151
exchange:
routing-keys:	input.myGroup
Payload {"name”:"Bob"}
----

As you can see from the above, your original message is preserved for further actions.

However, one thing you may have noticed is that there is limited information on the original issue with the message processing. For example, you do not see a stack
trace corresponding to the original error.
To get more relevant information about the original error, you must set an additional property:

[source,text]
----
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.republish-to-dlq=true
----

Doing so forces the internal error handler to intercept the error message and add additional information to it before publishing it to DLQ.
Once configured, you can see that the error message contains more information relevant to the original error, as follows:

[source,text]
----
delivery_mode:	2
headers:
x-original-exchange:
x-exception-message:	has an error
x-original-routingKey:	input.myGroup
x-exception-stacktrace:	org.springframework.messaging.MessageHandlingException: nested exception is
      org.springframework.messaging.MessagingException: has an error, failedMessage=GenericMessage [payload=byte[15],
      headers={amqp_receivedDeliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, amqp_receivedRoutingKey=input.hello, amqp_deliveryTag=1,
      deliveryAttempt=3, amqp_consumerQueue=input.hello, amqp_redelivered=false, id=a15231e6-3f80-677b-5ad7-d4b1e61e486e,
      amqp_consumerTag=amq.ctag-skBFapilvtZhDsn0k3ZmQg, contentType=application/json, timestamp=1522327846136}]
      at org.spring...integ...han...MethodInvokingMessageProcessor.processMessage(MethodInvokingMessageProcessor.java:107)
      at. . . . .
Payload {"name”:"Bob"}
----

This effectively combines application-level and system-level error handling to further assist with downstream troubleshooting mechanics.

===== Re-queue Failed Messages

As mentioned earlier, the currently supported binders (Rabbit and Kafka) rely on `RetryTemplate` to facilitate successful message processing. See <<Retry Template>> for details.
However, for cases when `max-attempts` property is set to 1, internal reprocessing of the message is disabled. At this point, you can facilitate message re-processing (re-tries)
by instructing the messaging system to re-queue the failed message. Once re-queued, the failed message is sent back to the original handler, essentially creating a retry loop.

This option may be feasible for cases where the nature of the error is related to some sporadic yet short-term unavailability of some resource.

To accomplish that, you must set the following properties:

[source,text]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.max-attempts=1
spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.input.consumer.requeue-rejected=true
----

In the preceding example, the `max-attempts` set to 1 essentially disabling internal re-tries and `requeue-rejected` (short for _requeue rejected messages_) is set to `true`.
Once set, the failed message is resubmitted to the same handler and loops continuously or until the handler throws `AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException`
essentially allowing you to build your own re-try logic within the handler itself.

==== Retry Template

The `RetryTemplate` is part of the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] library.
While it is out of scope of this document to cover all of the capabilities of the `RetryTemplate`, we will mention the following consumer properties that are specifically related to
the `RetryTemplate`:

maxAttempts::
The number of attempts to process the message.
+
Default: 3.
backOffInitialInterval::
The backoff initial interval on retry.
+
Default 1000 milliseconds.
backOffMaxInterval::
The maximum backoff interval.
+
Default 10000 milliseconds.
backOffMultiplier::
The backoff multiplier.
+
Default 2.0.
defaultRetryable::
Whether exceptions thrown by the listener that are not listed in the `retryableExceptions` are retryable.
+
Default: `true`.
retryableExceptions::
A map of Throwable class names in the key and a boolean in the value.
Specify those exceptions (and subclasses) that will or won't be retried.
Also see `defaultRetriable`.
Example: `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.retryable-exceptions.java.lang.IllegalStateException=false`.
+
Default: empty.

While the preceding settings are sufficient for majority of the customization requirements, they may not satisfy certain complex requirements at, which
point you may want to provide your own instance of the `RetryTemplate`. To do so configure it as a bean in your application configuration. The application provided
instance will override the one provided by the framework. Also, to avoid conflicts you must qualify the instance of the `RetryTemplate` you want to be used by the binder
as `@StreamRetryTemplate`. For example,

[source,java]
----
@StreamRetryTemplate
public RetryTemplate myRetryTemplate() {
    return new RetryTemplate();
}
----
As you can see from the above example you don't need to annotate it with `@Bean` since `@StreamRetryTemplate` is a qualified `@Bean`.

If you need to be more precise with your `RetryTemplate`, you can specify the bean by name in your `ConsumerProperties` to associate
the specific retry bean per binding.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<foo>.consumer.retry-template-name=<your-retry-template-bean-name>
----


[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-binders]]
== Binders

Spring Cloud Stream provides a Binder abstraction for use in connecting to physical destinations at the external middleware.
This section provides information about the main concepts behind the Binder SPI, its main components, and implementation-specific details.

=== Producers and Consumers

The following image shows the general relationship of producers and consumers:

.Producers and Consumers
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/producers-consumers.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

A producer is any component that sends messages to a channel.
The channel can be bound to an external message broker with a `Binder` implementation for that broker.
When invoking the `bindProducer()` method, the first parameter is the name of the destination within the broker, the second parameter is the local channel instance to which the producer sends messages, and the third parameter contains properties (such as a partition key expression) to be used within the adapter that is created for that channel.

A consumer is any component that receives messages from a channel.
As with a producer, the consumer's channel can be bound to an external message broker.
When invoking the `bindConsumer()` method, the first parameter is the destination name, and a second parameter provides the name of a logical group of consumers.
Each group that is represented by consumer bindings for a given destination receives a copy of each message that a producer sends to that destination (that is, it follows normal publish-subscribe semantics).
If there are multiple consumer instances bound with the same group name, then messages are load-balanced across those consumer instances so that each message sent by a producer is consumed by only a single consumer instance within each group (that is, it follows normal queueing semantics).

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-binder-api]]
=== Binder SPI

The Binder SPI consists of a number of interfaces, out-of-the box utility classes, and discovery strategies that provide a pluggable mechanism for connecting to external middleware.

The key point of the SPI is the `Binder` interface, which is a strategy for connecting inputs and outputs to external middleware. The following listing shows the definnition of the `Binder` interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface Binder<T, C extends ConsumerProperties, P extends ProducerProperties> {
    Binding<T> bindConsumer(String name, String group, T inboundBindTarget, C consumerProperties);

    Binding<T> bindProducer(String name, T outboundBindTarget, P producerProperties);
}
----

The interface is parameterized, offering a number of extension points:

* Input and output bind targets. As of version 1.0, only `MessageChannel` is supported, but this is intended to be used as an extension point in the future.
* Extended consumer and producer properties, allowing specific Binder implementations to add supplemental properties that can be supported in a type-safe manner.

A typical binder implementation consists of the following:

* A class that implements the `Binder` interface;
* A Spring `@Configuration` class that creates a bean of type `Binder` along with the middleware connection infrastructure.
* A `META-INF/spring.binders` file found on the classpath containing one or more binder definitions, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
kafka:\
org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.config.KafkaBinderConfiguration
----

=== Binder Detection

Spring Cloud Stream relies on implementations of the Binder SPI to perform the task of connecting channels to message brokers.
Each Binder implementation typically connects to one type of messaging system.

==== Classpath Detection

By default, Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot's auto-configuration to configure the binding process.
If a single Binder implementation is found on the classpath, Spring Cloud Stream automatically uses it.
For example, a Spring Cloud Stream project that aims to bind only to RabbitMQ can add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

For the specific Maven coordinates of other binder dependencies, see the documentation of that binder implementation.

[[multiple-binders]]
=== Multiple Binders on the Classpath

When multiple binders are present on the classpath, the application must indicate which binder is to be used for each channel binding.
Each binder configuration contains a `META-INF/spring.binders` file, which is a simple properties file, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
rabbit:\
org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.rabbit.config.RabbitServiceAutoConfiguration
----

Similar files exist for the other provided binder implementations (such as Kafka), and custom binder implementations are expected to provide them as well.
The key represents an identifying name for the binder implementation, whereas the value is a comma-separated list of configuration classes that each contain one and only one bean definition of type `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.Binder`.

Binder selection can either be performed globally, using the `spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder` property (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder=rabbit`) or individually, by configuring the binder on each channel binding.
For instance, a processor application (that has channels named `input` and `output` for read and write respectively) that reads from Kafka and writes to RabbitMQ can specify the following configuration:

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.binder=kafka
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.binder=rabbit
----

[[multiple-systems]]
=== Connecting to Multiple Systems

By default, binders share the application's Spring Boot auto-configuration, so that one instance of each binder found on the classpath is created.
If your application should connect to more than one broker of the same type, you can specify multiple binder configurations, each with different environment settings.

NOTE: Turning on explicit binder configuration disables the default binder configuration process altogether.
If you do so, all binders in use must be included in the configuration.
Frameworks that intend to use Spring Cloud Stream transparently may create binder configurations that can be referenced by name, but they do not affect the default binder configuration.
In order to do so, a binder configuration may have its `defaultCandidate` flag set to false (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.binders.<configurationName>.defaultCandidate=false`).
This denotes a configuration that exists independently of the default binder configuration process.

The following example shows a typical configuration for a processor application that connects to two RabbitMQ broker instances:

[source,yml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      bindings:
        input:
          destination: thing1
          binder: rabbit1
        output:
          destination: thing2
          binder: rabbit2
      binders:
        rabbit1:
          type: rabbit
          environment:
            spring:
              rabbitmq:
                host: <host1>
        rabbit2:
          type: rabbit
          environment:
            spring:
              rabbitmq:
                host: <host2>
----
NOTE: The `environment` property of the particular binder can also be used for any Spring Boot property,
including this `spring.main.sources` which can be useful for adding additional configurations for the
particular binders, e.g. overriding auto-configured beans.

For example;
[source, yaml]
----
environment:
    spring:
        main:
           sources: com.acme.config.MyCustomBinderConfiguration
----

To activate a specific profile for the particular binder environment, you should use a `spring.profiles.active` property:

[source, yaml]
----
environment:
    spring:
        profiles:
           active: myBinderProfile
----
[[binding_visualization_control]]
=== Binding visualization and control
Since version 2.0, Spring Cloud Stream supports visualization and control of the Bindings through Actuator endpoints.

Starting with version 2.0 actuator and web are optional, you must first add one of the web dependencies as well as add the actuator dependency manually.
The following example shows how to add the dependency for the Web framework:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The following example shows how to add the dependency for the WebFlux framework:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

You can add the Actuator dependency as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: To run Spring Cloud Stream 2.0 apps in Cloud Foundry, you must add `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to the classpath. Otherwise, the
application will not start due to health check failures.

You must also enable the `bindings` actuator endpoints by setting the following property: `--management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=bindings`.

Once those prerequisites are satisfied. you should see the following in the logs when application start:

	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[POST]. . .
	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings],methods=[GET]. . .
	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[GET]. . .

To visualize the current bindings, access the following URL:
`http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings`

Alternative, to see a single binding, access one of the URLs similar to the following:
`http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/<bindingName>`

You can also stop, start, pause, and resume individual bindings by posting to the same URL while providing a `state` argument as JSON, as shown in the following examples:

    curl -d '{"state":"STOPPED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"STARTED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"PAUSED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"RESUMED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName

NOTE: `PAUSED` and `RESUMED` work only when the corresponding binder and its underlying technology supports it. Otherwise, you see the warning message in the logs.
Currently, only Kafka binder supports the `PAUSED` and `RESUMED` states.

=== Binder Configuration Properties

The following properties are available when customizing binder configurations. These properties exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.config.BinderProperties`

They must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.binders.<configurationName>`.

type::
The binder type.
It typically references one of the binders found on the classpath -- in particular, a key in a `META-INF/spring.binders` file.
+
By default, it has the same value as the configuration name.
inheritEnvironment::
Whether the configuration inherits the environment of the application itself.
+
Default: `true`.
environment::
Root for a set of properties that can be used to customize the environment of the binder.
When this property is set, the context in which the binder is being created is not a child of the application context.
This setting allows for complete separation between the binder components and the application components.
+
Default: `empty`.
defaultCandidate::
Whether the binder configuration is a candidate for being considered a default binder or can be used only when explicitly referenced.
This setting allows adding binder configurations without interfering with the default processing.
+
Default: `true`.

== Configuration Options

Spring Cloud Stream supports general configuration options as well as configuration for bindings and binders.
Some binders let additional binding properties support middleware-specific features.

Configuration options can be provided to Spring Cloud Stream applications through any mechanism supported by Spring Boot.
This includes application arguments, environment variables, and YAML or .properties files.

=== Binding Service Properties

These properties are exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.config.BindingServiceProperties`

spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount::
The number of deployed instances of an application.
Must be set for partitioning on the producer side. Must be set on the consumer side when using RabbitMQ and with Kafka if `autoRebalanceEnabled=false`.
+
Default: `1`.

spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex::
The instance index of the application: A number from `0` to `instanceCount - 1`.
Used for partitioning with RabbitMQ and with Kafka if `autoRebalanceEnabled=false`.
Automatically set in Cloud Foundry to match the application's instance index.

spring.cloud.stream.dynamicDestinations::
A list of destinations that can be bound dynamically (for example, in a dynamic routing scenario).
If set, only listed destinations can be bound.
+
Default: empty (letting any destination be bound).

spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder::
The default binder to use, if multiple binders are configured.
See <<multiple-binders,Multiple Binders on the Classpath>>.
+
Default: empty.

spring.cloud.stream.overrideCloudConnectors::
This property is only applicable when the `cloud` profile is active and Spring Cloud Connectors are provided with the application.
If the property is `false` (the default), the binder detects a suitable bound service (for example, a RabbitMQ service bound in Cloud Foundry for the RabbitMQ binder) and uses it for creating connections (usually through Spring Cloud Connectors).
When set to `true`, this property instructs binders to completely ignore the bound services and rely on Spring Boot properties (for example, relying on the `spring.rabbitmq.*` properties provided in the environment for the RabbitMQ binder).
The typical usage of this property is to be nested in a customized environment <<multiple-systems, when connecting to multiple systems>>.
+
Default: `false`.

spring.cloud.stream.bindingRetryInterval::
The interval (in seconds) between retrying binding creation when, for example, the binder does not support late binding and the broker (for example, Apache Kafka) is down.
Set it to zero to treat such conditions as fatal, preventing the application from starting.
+
Default: `30`

[[binding-properties]]
=== Binding Properties

Binding properties are supplied by using the format of `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.<property>=<value>`.
The `<channelName>` represents the name of the channel being configured (for example, `output` for a `Source`).

To avoid repetition, Spring Cloud Stream supports setting values for all channels, in the format of `spring.cloud.stream.default.<property>=<value>`.

When it comes to avoiding repetitions for extended binding properties, this format should be used - `spring.cloud.stream.<binder-type>.default.<producer|consumer>.<property>=<value>`.

In what follows, we indicate where we have omitted the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.` prefix and focus just on the property name, with the understanding that the prefix ise included at runtime.

==== Common Binding Properties

These properties are exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.config.BindingProperties`

The following binding properties are available for both input and output bindings and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.` (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=ticktock`).

Default values can be set by using the `spring.cloud.stream.default` prefix (for example`spring.cloud.stream.default.contentType=application/json`).

destination::
The target destination of a channel on the bound middleware (for example, the RabbitMQ exchange or Kafka topic).
If the channel is bound as a consumer, it could be bound to multiple destinations, and the destination names can be specified as comma-separated `String` values.
If not set, the channel name is used instead.
The default value of this property cannot be overridden.
group::
The consumer group of the channel.
Applies only to inbound bindings.
See <<consumer-groups,Consumer Groups>>.
+
Default: `null` (indicating an anonymous consumer).
contentType::
The content type of the channel.
See `<<content-type-management>>`.
+
Default: `application/json`.
binder::
The binder used by this binding.
See `<<multiple-binders>>` for details.
+
Default: `null` (the default binder is used, if it exists).

==== Consumer Properties

These properties are exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.ConsumerProperties`

The following binding properties are available for input bindings only and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.consumer.` (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.concurrency=3`).

Default values can be set by using the `spring.cloud.stream.default.consumer` prefix (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.default.consumer.headerMode=none`).

autoStartup::
Signals if this consumer needs to be started automatically
+
Default: `true`.
concurrency::
The concurrency of the inbound consumer.
+
Default: `1`.
partitioned::
Whether the consumer receives data from a partitioned producer.
+
Default: `false`.
headerMode::
When set to `none`, disables header parsing on input.
Effective only for messaging middleware that does not support message headers natively and requires header embedding.
This option is useful when consuming data from non-Spring Cloud Stream applications when native headers are not supported.
When set to `headers`, it uses the middleware's native header mechanism.
When set to `embeddedHeaders`, it embeds headers into the message payload.
+
Default: depends on the binder implementation.
maxAttempts::
If processing fails, the number of attempts to process the message (including the first).
Set to `1` to disable retry.
+
Default: `3`.
backOffInitialInterval::
The backoff initial interval on retry.
+
Default: `1000`.
backOffMaxInterval::
The maximum backoff interval.
+
Default: `10000`.
backOffMultiplier::
The backoff multiplier.
+
Default: `2.0`.
defaultRetryable::
Whether exceptions thrown by the listener that are not listed in the `retryableExceptions` are retryable.
+
Default: `true`.
instanceIndex::
When set to a value greater than equal to zero, it allows customizing the instance index of this consumer (if different from `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex`).
When set to a negative value, it defaults to `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex`.
See `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count>>` for more information.
+
Default: `-1`.
instanceCount::
When set to a value greater than equal to zero, it allows customizing the instance count of this consumer (if different from `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount`).
When set to a negative value, it defaults to `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount`.
See `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count>>` for more information.
+
Default: `-1`.
retryableExceptions::
A map of Throwable class names in the key and a boolean in the value.
Specify those exceptions (and subclasses) that will or won't be retried.
Also see `defaultRetriable`.
Example: `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.retryable-exceptions.java.lang.IllegalStateException=false`.
+
Default: empty.
useNativeDecoding::
When set to `true`, the inbound message is deserialized directly by the client library, which must be configured correspondingly (for example, setting an appropriate Kafka producer value deserializer).
When this configuration is being used, the inbound message unmarshalling is not based on the `contentType` of the binding.
When native decoding is used, it is the responsibility of the producer to use an appropriate encoder (for example, the Kafka producer value serializer) to serialize the outbound message.
Also, when native encoding and decoding is used, the `headerMode=embeddedHeaders` property is ignored and headers are not embedded in the message.
See the producer property `useNativeEncoding`.
+
Default: `false`.

==== Advanced Consumer Configuration

For advanced configuration of the underlying message listener container for message-driven consumers, add a single `ListenerContainerCustomizer` bean to the application context.
It will be invoked after the above properties have been applied and can be used to set additional properties.
Similarly, for polled consumers, add a `MessageSourceCustomizer` bean.

The following is an example for the RabbitMQ binder:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ListenerContainerCustomizer<AbstractMessageListenerContainer> containerCustomizer() {
    return (container, dest, group) -> container.setAdviceChain(advice1, advice2);
}

@Bean
public MessageSourceCustomizer<AmqpMessageSource> sourceCustomizer() {
    return (source, dest, group) -> source.setPropertiesConverter(customPropertiesConverter);
}
----
====

==== Producer Properties

These properties are exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.ProducerProperties`

The following binding properties are available for output bindings only and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<channelName>.producer.` (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id`).

Default values can be set by using the prefix `spring.cloud.stream.default.producer` (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.default.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id`).

autoStartup::
Signals if this consumer needs to be started automatically
+
Default: `true`.
partitionKeyExpression::
A SpEL expression that determines how to partition outbound data.
If set, or if `partitionKeyExtractorClass` is set, outbound data on this channel is partitioned. `partitionCount` must be set to a value greater than 1 to be effective.
Mutually exclusive with `partitionKeyExtractorClass`.
See `<<partitioning>>`.
+
Default: null.
partitionKeyExtractorClass::
A `PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy` implementation.
If set, or if `partitionKeyExpression` is set, outbound data on this channel is partitioned. `partitionCount` must be set to a value greater than 1 to be effective.
Mutually exclusive with `partitionKeyExpression`.
See `<<partitioning>>`.
+
Default: `null`.
partitionSelectorClass::
  A `PartitionSelectorStrategy` implementation.
Mutually exclusive with `partitionSelectorExpression`.
If neither is set, the partition is selected as the `hashCode(key) % partitionCount`, where `key` is computed through either `partitionKeyExpression` or `partitionKeyExtractorClass`.
+
Default: `null`.
partitionSelectorExpression::
A SpEL expression for customizing partition selection.
Mutually exclusive with `partitionSelectorClass`.
If neither is set, the partition is selected as the `hashCode(key) % partitionCount`, where `key` is computed through either `partitionKeyExpression` or `partitionKeyExtractorClass`.
+
Default: `null`.
partitionCount::
The number of target partitions for the data, if partitioning is enabled.
Must be set to a value greater than 1 if the producer is partitioned.
On Kafka, it is interpreted as a hint. The larger of this and the partition count of the target topic is used instead.
+
Default: `1`.
requiredGroups::
A comma-separated list of groups to which the producer must ensure message delivery even if they start after it has been created (for example, by pre-creating durable queues in RabbitMQ).
headerMode::
When set to `none`, it disables header embedding on output.
It is effective only for messaging middleware that does not support message headers natively and requires header embedding.
This option is useful when producing data for non-Spring Cloud Stream applications when native headers are not supported.
When set to `headers`, it uses the middleware's native header mechanism.
When set to `embeddedHeaders`, it embeds headers into the message payload.
+
Default: Depends on the binder implementation.
useNativeEncoding::
When set to `true`, the outbound message is serialized directly by the client library, which must be configured correspondingly (for example, setting an appropriate Kafka producer value serializer).
When this configuration is being used, the outbound message marshalling is not based on the `contentType` of the binding.
When native encoding is used, it is the responsibility of the consumer to use an appropriate decoder (for example, the Kafka consumer value de-serializer) to deserialize the inbound message.
Also, when native encoding and decoding is used, the `headerMode=embeddedHeaders` property is ignored and headers are not embedded in the message.
See the consumer property `useNativeDecoding`.
+
Default: `false`.
errorChannelEnabled::
When set to `true`, if the binder supports asynchroous send results, send failures are sent to an error channel for the destination.
See `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling>>` for more information.
+
Default: `false`.

[[dynamicdestination]]
=== Using Dynamically Bound Destinations

Besides the channels defined by using `@EnableBinding`, Spring Cloud Stream lets applications send messages to dynamically bound destinations.
This is useful, for example, when the target destination needs to be determined at runtime.
Applications can do so by using the `BinderAwareChannelResolver` bean, registered automatically by the `@EnableBinding` annotation.

The 'spring.cloud.stream.dynamicDestinations' property can be used for restricting the dynamic destination names to a known set (whitelisting).
If this property is not set, any destination can be bound dynamically.

The `BinderAwareChannelResolver` can be used directly, as shown in the following example of a REST controller using a path variable to decide the target channel:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

    @Autowired
    private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;

    @RequestMapping(path = "/{target}", method = POST, consumes = "*/*")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
    public void handleRequest(@RequestBody String body, @PathVariable("target") target,
           @RequestHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE) Object contentType) {
        sendMessage(body, target, contentType);
    }

    private void sendMessage(String body, String target, Object contentType) {
        resolver.resolveDestination(target).send(MessageBuilder.createMessage(body,
                new MessageHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, contentType))));
    }
}
----

Now consider what happens when we start the application on the default port (8080) and make the following requests with CURL:

----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "customer-1" http://localhost:8080/customers

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "order-1" http://localhost:8080/orders
----

The destinations, 'customers' and 'orders', are created in the broker (in the exchange for Rabbit or in the topic for Kafka) with names of 'customers' and 'orders', and the data is published to the appropriate destinations.

The `BinderAwareChannelResolver` is a general-purpose Spring Integration `DestinationResolver` and can be injected in other components -- for example, in a router using a SpEL expression based on the `target` field of an incoming JSON message. The following example includes a router that reads SpEL expressions:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

    @Autowired
    private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;


    @RequestMapping(path = "/", method = POST, consumes = "application/json")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
    public void handleRequest(@RequestBody String body, @RequestHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE) Object contentType) {
        sendMessage(body, contentType);
    }

    private void sendMessage(Object body, Object contentType) {
        routerChannel().send(MessageBuilder.createMessage(body,
                new MessageHeaders(Collections.singletonMap(MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, contentType))));
    }

    @Bean(name = "routerChannel")
    public MessageChannel routerChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Bean
    @ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "routerChannel")
    public ExpressionEvaluatingRouter router() {
        ExpressionEvaluatingRouter router =
            new ExpressionEvaluatingRouter(new SpelExpressionParser().parseExpression("payload.target"));
        router.setDefaultOutputChannelName("default-output");
        router.setChannelResolver(resolver);
        return router;
    }
}
----

The https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/router[Router Sink Application] uses this technique to create the destinations on-demand.

If the channel names are known in advance, you can configure the producer properties as with any other destination.
Alternatively, if you register a `NewDestinationBindingCallback<>` bean, it is invoked just before the binding is created.
The callback takes the generic type of the extended producer properties used by the binder.
It has one method:

[source, java]
----
void configure(String channelName, MessageChannel channel, ProducerProperties producerProperties,
        T extendedProducerProperties);
----

The following example shows how to use the RabbitMQ binder:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public NewDestinationBindingCallback<RabbitProducerProperties> dynamicConfigurer() {
    return (name, channel, props, extended) -> {
        props.setRequiredGroups("bindThisQueue");
        extended.setQueueNameGroupOnly(true);
        extended.setAutoBindDlq(true);
        extended.setDeadLetterQueueName("myDLQ");
    };
}
----

NOTE: If you need to support dynamic destinations with multiple binder types, use `Object` for the generic type and cast the `extended` argument as needed.

[[content-type-management]]
== Content Type Negotiation

Data transformation is one of the core features of any message-driven microservice architecture. Given that, in Spring Cloud Stream, such data
is represented as a Spring `Message`, a message may have to be transformed to a desired shape or size before reaching its destination. This is required for two reasons:

. To convert the contents of the incoming message to match the signature of the application-provided handler.

. To convert the contents of the outgoing message to the wire format.

The wire format is typically `byte[]` (that is true for the Kafka and Rabbit binders), but it is governed by the binder implementation.

In Spring Cloud Stream, message transformation is accomplished with an `org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter`.

NOTE: As a supplement to the details to follow, you may also want to read the following https://spring.io/blog/2018/02/26/spring-cloud-stream-2-0-content-type-negotiation-and-transformation[blog post].

=== Mechanics

To better understand the mechanics and the necessity behind content-type negotiation, we take a look at a very simple use case by using the following message handler as an example:

[source, java]
----
@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
public String handle(Person person) {..}
----

NOTE: For simplicity, we assume that this is the only handler in the application (we assume there is no internal pipeline).

The handler shown in the preceding example expects a `Person` object as an argument and produces a `String` type as an output.
In order for the framework to succeed in passing the incoming `Message` as an argument to this handler, it has to somehow transform the payload of the `Message` type from the wire format to a `Person` type.
In other words, the framework must locate and apply the appropriate `MessageConverter`.
To accomplish that, the framework needs some instructions from the user.
One of these instructions is already provided by the signature of the handler method itself (`Person` type).
Consequently, in theory, that should be (and, in some cases, is) enough.
However, for the majority of use cases, in order to select the appropriate `MessageConverter`, the framework needs an additional piece of information.
That missing piece is `contentType`.

Spring Cloud Stream provides three mechanisms to define `contentType` (in order of precedence):

. *HEADER*: The `contentType` can be communicated through the Message itself. By providing a `contentType` header, you declare the content type to use to locate and apply the appropriate `MessageConverter`.

. *BINDING*: The `contentType` can be set per destination binding by setting the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.content-type` property.
+
NOTE: The `input` segment in the property name corresponds to the actual name of the destination (which is “input” in our case). This approach lets you declare, on a per-binding basis, the content type to use to locate and apply the appropriate `MessageConverter`.

. *DEFAULT*: If `contentType` is not present in the `Message` header or the binding, the default `application/json` content type is used to
locate and apply the appropriate `MessageConverter`.

As mentioned earlier, the preceding list also demonstrates the order of precedence in case of a tie. For example, a header-provided content type takes precedence over any other content type.
The same applies for a content type set on a per-binding basis, which essentially lets you override the default content type.
However, it also provides a sensible default (which was determined from community feedback).

Another reason for making `application/json` the default stems from the interoperability requirements driven by distributed microservices architectures, where producer and consumer not only run in different JVMs but can also run on different non-JVM platforms.

When the non-void handler method returns, if the the return value is already a `Message`, that `Message` becomes the payload. However, when the return value is not a `Message`, the new `Message` is constructed with the return value as the payload while inheriting
headers from the input `Message` minus the headers defined or filtered by `SpringIntegrationProperties.messageHandlerNotPropagatedHeaders`.
By default, there is only one header set there: `contentType`. This means that the new `Message` does not have `contentType` header set, thus ensuring that the `contentType` can evolve.
You can always opt out of returning a `Message` from the handler method where you can inject any header you wish.

If there is an internal pipeline, the `Message` is sent to the next handler by going through the same process of conversion. However, if there is no internal pipeline or you have reached the end of it, the `Message` is sent back to the output destination.

==== Content Type versus Argument Type

As mentioned earlier, for the framework to select the appropriate `MessageConverter`, it requires argument type and, optionally, content type information.
The logic for selecting the appropriate `MessageConverter` resides with the argument resolvers (`HandlerMethodArgumentResolvers`), which trigger right before the invocation of the user-defined handler method (which is when the actual argument type is known to the framework).
If the argument type does not match the type of the current payload, the framework delegates to the stack of the
pre-configured `MessageConverters` to see if any one of them can convert the payload.
As you can see, the  `Object fromMessage(Message<?> message, Class<?> targetClass);`
operation of the MessageConverter takes `targetClass` as one of its arguments.
The framework also ensures that the provided `Message` always contains a `contentType` header.
When no contentType header was already present, it injects either the per-binding `contentType` header or the default `contentType` header.
The combination of `contentType` argument type is the mechanism by which framework determines if message can be converted to a target type.
If no appropriate `MessageConverter` is found, an exception is thrown, which you can handle by adding a custom `MessageConverter` (see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-user-defined-message-converters>>`).

But what if the payload type matches the target type declared by the handler method? In this case, there is nothing to convert, and the
payload is passed unmodified. While this sounds pretty straightforward and logical, keep in mind handler methods that take a `Message<?>` or `Object` as an argument.
By declaring the target type to be `Object` (which is an `instanceof` everything in Java), you essentially forfeit the conversion process.

NOTE: Do not expect `Message` to be converted into some other type based only on the `contentType`.
Remember that the `contentType` is complementary to the target type.
If you wish, you can provide a hint, which `MessageConverter` may or may not take into consideration.

==== Message Converters

`MessageConverters` define two methods:

[source, java]
----
Object fromMessage(Message<?> message, Class<?> targetClass);

Message<?> toMessage(Object payload, @Nullable MessageHeaders headers);
----

It is important to understand the contract of these methods and their usage, specifically in the context of Spring Cloud Stream.

The `fromMessage` method converts an incoming `Message` to an argument type.
The payload of the `Message` could be any type, and it is
up to the actual implementation of the `MessageConverter` to support multiple types.
For example, some JSON converter may support the payload type as `byte[]`, `String`, and others.
This is important when the application contains an internal pipeline (that is, input -> handler1 -> handler2 ->. . . -> output) and the output of the upstream handler results in a `Message` which may not be in the initial wire format.

However, the `toMessage` method has a more strict contract and must always convert `Message` to the wire format: `byte[]`.

So, for all intents and purposes (and especially when implementing your own converter) you regard the two methods as having the following signatures:

[source, java]
----
Object fromMessage(Message<?> message, Class<?> targetClass);

Message<byte[]> toMessage(Object payload, @Nullable MessageHeaders headers);
----

=== Provided MessageConverters

As mentioned earlier, the framework already provides a stack of `MessageConverters` to handle most common use cases.
The following list describes the provided `MessageConverters`, in order of precedence (the first `MessageConverter` that works is used):

. `ApplicationJsonMessageMarshallingConverter`: Variation of the `org.springframework.messaging.converter.MappingJackson2MessageConverter`. Supports conversion of the payload of the `Message` to/from POJO for cases when `contentType` is `application/json` (DEFAULT).
. `TupleJsonMessageConverter`: *DEPRECATED* Supports conversion of the payload of the `Message` to/from `org.springframework.tuple.Tuple`.
. `ByteArrayMessageConverter`: Supports conversion of the payload of the `Message` from `byte[]` to `byte[]` for cases when `contentType` is `application/octet-stream`. It is essentially a pass through and exists primarily for backward compatibility.
. `ObjectStringMessageConverter`: Supports conversion of any type to a `String` when `contentType` is `text/plain`.
It invokes Object’s `toString()` method or, if the payload is `byte[]`, a new `String(byte[])`.
. `JavaSerializationMessageConverter`: *DEPRECATED* Supports conversion based on java serialization when `contentType` is `application/x-java-serialized-object`.
. `KryoMessageConverter`: *DEPRECATED* Supports conversion based on Kryo serialization when `contentType` is `application/x-java-object`.
. `JsonUnmarshallingConverter`: Similar to the `ApplicationJsonMessageMarshallingConverter`. It supports conversion of any type when `contentType` is `application/x-java-object`.
It expects the actual type information to be embedded in the `contentType` as an attribute (for example, `application/x-java-object;type=foo.bar.Cat`).

When no appropriate converter is found, the framework throws an exception. When that happens, you should check your code and configuration and ensure you did not miss anything (that is, ensure that you provided a `contentType` by using a binding or a header).
However, most likely, you found some uncommon case (such as a custom `contentType` perhaps) and the current stack of provided `MessageConverters`
does not know how to convert. If that is the case, you can add custom `MessageConverter`. See <<spring-cloud-stream-overview-user-defined-message-converters>>.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-user-defined-message-converters]]
=== User-defined Message Converters

Spring Cloud Stream exposes a mechanism to define and register additional `MessageConverters`.
To use it, implement `org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter`, configure it as a `@Bean`, and annotate it with `@StreamMessageConverter`.
It is then apended to the existing stack of `MessageConverter`s.

NOTE: It is important to understand that custom `MessageConverter` implementations are added to the head of the existing stack.
Consequently, custom `MessageConverter` implementations take precedence over the existing ones, which lets you override as well as add to the existing converters.

The following example shows how to create a message converter bean to support a new content type called `application/bar`:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SinkApplication {

    ...

    @Bean
    @StreamMessageConverter
    public MessageConverter customMessageConverter() {
        return new MyCustomMessageConverter();
    }
}

public class MyCustomMessageConverter extends AbstractMessageConverter {

    public MyCustomMessageConverter() {
        super(new MimeType("application", "bar"));
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean supports(Class<?> clazz) {
        return (Bar.class.equals(clazz));
    }

    @Override
    protected Object convertFromInternal(Message<?> message, Class<?> targetClass, Object conversionHint) {
        Object payload = message.getPayload();
        return (payload instanceof Bar ? payload : new Bar((byte[]) payload));
    }
}
----

Spring Cloud Stream also provides support for Avro-based converters and schema evolution.
See `<<schema-evolution>>` for details.

[[schema-evolution]]
== Schema Evolution Support

Spring Cloud Stream provides support for schema evolution so that the data can be evolved over time and still work with older or newer producers and consumers and vice versa.
Most serialization models, especially the ones that aim for portability across different platforms and languages, rely on a schema that describes how the data is serialized in the binary payload.
In order to serialize the data and then to interpret it, both the sending and receiving sides must have access to a schema that describes the binary format.
In certain cases, the schema can be inferred from the payload type on serialization or from the target type on deserialization.
However, many applications benefit from having access to an explicit schema that describes the binary data format.
A schema registry lets you store schema information in a textual format (typically JSON) and makes that information accessible to various applications that need it to receive and send data in binary format.
A schema is referenceable as a tuple consisting of:

*    A subject that is the logical name of the schema
*    The schema version
*    The schema format, which describes the binary format of the data

This following sections goes through the details of various components involved in schema evolution process.

=== Schema Registry Client

The client-side abstraction for interacting with schema registry servers is the `SchemaRegistryClient` interface, which has the following structure:

[source,java]
----
public interface SchemaRegistryClient {

    SchemaRegistrationResponse register(String subject, String format, String schema);

    String fetch(SchemaReference schemaReference);

    String fetch(Integer id);

}
----

Spring Cloud Stream provides out-of-the-box implementations for interacting with its own schema server and for interacting with the Confluent Schema Registry.

A client for the Spring Cloud Stream schema registry can be configured by using the `@EnableSchemaRegistryClient`, as follows:

[source,java]
----
  @EnableBinding(Sink.class)
  @SpringBootApplication
  @EnableSchemaRegistryClient
  public static class AvroSinkApplication {
    ...
  }
----

NOTE: The default converter is optimized to cache not only the schemas from the remote server but also the `parse()` and `toString()` methods, which are quite expensive.
Because of this, it uses a `DefaultSchemaRegistryClient` that does not cache responses.
If you intend to change the default behavior, you can use the client directly on your code and override it to the desired outcome.
To do so, you have to add the property `spring.cloud.stream.schemaRegistryClient.cached=true` to your application properties.

==== Schema Registry Client Properties

The Schema Registry Client supports the following properties:

`spring.cloud.stream.schemaRegistryClient.endpoint`:: The location of the schema-server.
When setting this, use a full URL, including protocol (`http` or `https`) , port, and context path.
+
Default:: `http://localhost:8990/`
`spring.cloud.stream.schemaRegistryClient.cached`:: Whether the client should cache schema server responses.
Normally set to `false`, as the caching happens in the message converter.
Clients using the schema registry client should set this to `true`.
+
Default:: `false`

=== Avro Schema Registry Client Message Converters

For applications that have a SchemaRegistryClient bean registered with the application context, Spring Cloud Stream auto configures an Apache Avro message converter for schema management.
This eases schema evolution, as applications that receive messages can get easy access to a writer schema that can be reconciled with their own reader schema.

For outbound messages, if the content type of the channel is set to `application/*+avro`, the `MessageConverter` is activated, as shown in the following example:

[source,properties]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.contentType=application/*+avro
----

During the outbound conversion, the message converter tries to infer the schema of each outbound messages (based on its type) and register it to a subject (based on the payload type) by using the `SchemaRegistryClient`.
If an identical schema is already found, then a reference to it is retrieved.
If not, the schema is registered, and a new version number is provided.
The message is sent with a `contentType` header by using the following scheme: `application/[prefix].[subject].v[version]+avro`, where `prefix` is configurable and `subject` is deduced from the payload type.

For example, a message of the type `User` might be sent as a binary payload with a content type of `application/vnd.user.v2+avro`, where `user` is the subject and `2` is the version number.

When receiving messages, the converter infers the schema reference from the header of the incoming message and tries to retrieve it. The schema is used as the writer schema in the deserialization process.

==== Avro Schema Registry Message Converter Properties

If you have enabled Avro based schema registry client by setting `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.contentType=application/*+avro`, you can customize the behavior of the registration by setting the following properties.

spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.dynamicSchemaGenerationEnabled:: Enable if you want the converter to use reflection to infer a Schema from a POJO.
+
Default: `false`
+
spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.readerSchema:: Avro compares schema versions by looking at a writer schema (origin payload) and a reader schema (your application payload). See the https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.6/spec.html[Avro documentation] for more information. If set, this overrides any lookups at the schema server and uses the local schema as the reader schema.
Default: `null`
+
spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.schemaLocations:: Registers any `.avsc` files listed in this property with the Schema Server.
+
Default: `empty`
+
spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.prefix:: The prefix to be used on the Content-Type header.
+
Default: `vnd`

=== Apache Avro Message Converters

Spring Cloud Stream provides support for schema-based message converters through its `spring-cloud-stream-schema` module.
Currently, the only serialization format supported out of the box for schema-based message converters is Apache Avro, with more formats to be added in future versions.

The `spring-cloud-stream-schema` module contains two types of message converters that can be used for Apache Avro serialization:

* Converters that use the class information of the serialized or deserialized objects or a schema with a location known at startup.
* Converters that use a schema registry. They locate the schemas at runtime and dynamically register new schemas as domain objects evolve.

=== Converters with Schema Support

The `AvroSchemaMessageConverter` supports serializing and deserializing messages either by using a predefined schema or by using the schema information available in the class (either reflectively or contained in the `SpecificRecord`).
If you provide a custom converter, then the default AvroSchemaMessageConverter bean is not created. The following example shows a custom converter:

To use custom converters, you can simply add it to the application context, optionally specifying one or more `MimeTypes` with which to associate it.
The default `MimeType` is `application/avro`.

If the target type of the conversion is a `GenericRecord`, a schema must be set.

The following example shows how to configure a converter in a sink application by registering the Apache Avro `MessageConverter` without a predefined schema.
In this example, note that the mime type value is `avro/bytes`, not the default `application/avro`.

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SinkApplication {

  ...

  @Bean
  public MessageConverter userMessageConverter() {
      return new AvroSchemaMessageConverter(MimeType.valueOf("avro/bytes"));
  }
}
----

Conversely, the following application registers a converter with a predefined schema (found on the classpath):

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SinkApplication {

  ...

  @Bean
  public MessageConverter userMessageConverter() {
      AvroSchemaMessageConverter converter = new AvroSchemaMessageConverter(MimeType.valueOf("avro/bytes"));
      converter.setSchemaLocation(new ClassPathResource("schemas/User.avro"));
      return converter;
  }
}
----

=== Schema Registry Server

Spring Cloud Stream provides a schema registry server implementation.
To use it, you can add the `spring-cloud-stream-schema-server` artifact to your project and use the `@EnableSchemaRegistryServer` annotation, which adds the schema registry server REST controller to your application.
This annotation is intended to be used with Spring Boot web applications, and the listening port of the server is controlled by the `server.port` property.
The `spring.cloud.stream.schema.server.path` property can be used to control the root path of the schema server (especially when it is embedded in other applications).
The `spring.cloud.stream.schema.server.allowSchemaDeletion` boolean property enables the deletion of a schema. By default, this is disabled.

The schema registry server uses a relational database to store the schemas.
By default, it uses an embedded database.
You can customize the schema storage by using the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-sql[Spring Boot SQL database and JDBC configuration options].

The following example shows a Spring Boot application that enables the schema registry:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSchemaRegistryServer
public class SchemaRegistryServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SchemaRegistryServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

==== Schema Registry Server API

The Schema Registry Server API consists of the following operations:

* `POST /` -- see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-registering-new-schema>>`
* 'GET /{subject}/{format}/{version}' -- see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-retrieve-schema-subject-format-version>>`
* `GET /{subject}/{format}` -- see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-retrieve-schema-subject-format>>`
* `GET /schemas/{id}` -- see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-retrieve-schema-id>>`
* `DELETE /{subject}/{format}/{version}` -- see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-deleting-schema-subject-format-version>>`
* `DELETE /schemas/{id}` -- see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-deleting-schema-id>>`
* `DELETE /{subject}` -- see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-deleting-schema-subject>>`

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-registering-new-schema]]
===== Registering a New Schema

To register a new schema, send a `POST` request to the `/` endpoint.

The `/` accepts a JSON payload  with the following fields:

*   `subject`: The schema subject
*   `format`: The schema format
*   `definition`: The schema definition

Its response is a schema object in JSON, with the following fields:

*   `id`: The schema ID
*   `subject`: The schema subject
*   `format`: The schema format
*   `version`: The schema version
*   `definition`: The schema definition

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-retrieve-schema-subject-format-version]]
===== Retrieving an Existing Schema by Subject, Format, and Version

To retrieve an existing schema by subject, format, and version, send `GET` request to the `/{subject}/{format}/{version}` endpoint.

Its response is a schema object in JSON, with the following fields:

*   `id`: The schema ID
*   `subject`: The schema subject
*   `format`: The schema format
*   `version`: The schema version
*   `definition`: The schema definition

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-retrieve-schema-subject-format]]
===== Retrieving an Existing Schema by Subject and Format

To retrieve an existing schema by subject and format, send a `GET` request to the `/subject/format` endpoint.

Its response is a list of schemas with each schema object in JSON, with the following fields:

*   `id`: The schema ID
*   `subject`: The schema subject
*   `format`: The schema format
*   `version`: The schema version
*   `definition`: The schema definition

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-retrieve-schema-id]]
===== Retrieving an Existing Schema by ID

To retrieve a schema by its ID, send a `GET` request to the `/schemas/{id}` endpoint.

Its response is a schema object in JSON, with the following fields:

*   `id`: The schema ID
*   `subject`: The schema subject
*   `format`: The schema format
*   `version`: The schema version
*   `definition`: The schema definition

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-deleting-schema-subject-format-version]]
===== Deleting a Schema by Subject, Format, and Version

To delete a schema identified by its subject, format, and version, send a `DELETE` request to the `/{subject}/{format}/{version}` endpoint.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-deleting-schema-id]]
===== Deleting a Schema by ID

To delete a schema by its ID, send a `DELETE` request to the `/schemas/{id}` endpoint.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-deleting-schema-subject]]
===== Deleting a Schema by Subject
`DELETE /{subject}`

Delete existing schemas by their subject.

NOTE: This note applies to users of Spring Cloud Stream 1.1.0.RELEASE only.
Spring Cloud Stream 1.1.0.RELEASE used the table name, `schema`, for storing `Schema` objects. `Schema` is a keyword in a number of database implementations.
To avoid any conflicts in the future, starting with 1.1.1.RELEASE, we have opted for the name `SCHEMA_REPOSITORY` for the storage table.
Any Spring Cloud Stream 1.1.0.RELEASE users who upgrade should migrate their existing schemas to the new table before upgrading.

==== Using Confluent's Schema Registry

The default configuration creates a `DefaultSchemaRegistryClient` bean.
If you want to use the Confluent schema registry, you need to create a bean of type `ConfluentSchemaRegistryClient`, which supersedes the one configured by default by the framework. The following example shows how to create such a bean:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public SchemaRegistryClient schemaRegistryClient(@Value("${spring.cloud.stream.schemaRegistryClient.endpoint}") String endpoint){
  ConfluentSchemaRegistryClient client = new ConfluentSchemaRegistryClient();
  client.setEndpoint(endpoint);
  return client;
}
----
NOTE: The ConfluentSchemaRegistryClient is tested against Confluent platform version 4.0.0.

=== Schema Registration and Resolution

To better understand how Spring Cloud Stream registers and resolves new schemas and its use of Avro schema comparison features, we provide two separate subsections:

* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-schema-registration-process>>`
* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-schema-resolution-process>>`

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-schema-registration-process]]
==== Schema Registration Process (Serialization)

The first part of the registration process is extracting a schema from the payload that is being sent over a channel.
Avro types such as `SpecificRecord` or `GenericRecord` already contain a schema, which can be retrieved immediately from the instance.
In the case of POJOs, a schema is inferred if the `spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.dynamicSchemaGenerationEnabled` property is set to `true` (the default).

.Schema Writer Resolution Process
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/schema_resolution.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

Ones a schema is obtained, the converter loads its metadata (version) from the remote server.
First, it queries a local cache. If no result is found, it submits the data to the server, which replies with versioning information.
The converter always caches the results to avoid the overhead of querying the Schema Server for every new message that needs to be serialized.

.Schema Registration Process
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/registration.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

With the schema version information, the converter sets the `contentType` header of the message to carry the version information -- for example: `application/vnd.user.v1+avro`.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-schema-resolution-process]]
==== Schema Resolution Process (Deserialization)

When reading messages that contain version information (that is, a `contentType` header with a scheme like the one described under `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-schema-registration-process>>`, the converter queries the Schema server to fetch the writer schema of the message.
Once it has found the correct schema of the incoming message, it retrieves the reader schema and, by using Avro's schema resolution support, reads it into the reader definition (setting defaults and any missing properties).

.Schema Reading Resolution Process
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/schema_reading.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

NOTE: You should understand the difference between a writer schema (the application that wrote the message) and a reader schema (the receiving application).
We suggest taking a moment to read https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.6/spec.html[the Avro terminology] and understand the process.
Spring Cloud Stream always fetches the writer schema to determine how to read a message.
If you want to get Avro's schema evolution support working, you need to make sure that a `readerSchema` was properly set for your application.

== Inter-Application Communication

Spring Cloud Stream enables communication between applications. Inter-application communication is a complex issue spanning several concerns, as described in the following topics:

* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-connecting-multiple-application-instances>>`
* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count>>`
* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-partitioning>>`

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-connecting-multiple-application-instances]]
=== Connecting Multiple Application Instances

While Spring Cloud Stream makes it easy for individual Spring Boot applications to connect to messaging systems, the typical scenario for Spring Cloud Stream is the creation of multi-application pipelines, where microservice applications send data to each other.
You can achieve this scenario by correlating the input and output destinations of "`adjacent`" applications.

Suppose a design calls for the Time Source application to send data to the Log Sink application. You could use a common destination named `ticktock` for bindings within both applications.

Time Source (that has the channel name `output`) would set the following property:

----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=ticktock
----

Log Sink (that has the channel name `input`) would set the following property:

----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=ticktock
----

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count]]
=== Instance Index and Instance Count

When scaling up Spring Cloud Stream applications, each instance can receive information about how many other instances of the same application exist and what its own instance index is.
Spring Cloud Stream does this through the `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` properties.
For example, if there are three instances of a HDFS sink application, all three instances have `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` set to `3`, and the individual applications have `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` set to `0`, `1`, and `2`, respectively.

When Spring Cloud Stream applications are deployed through Spring Cloud Data Flow, these properties are configured automatically; when Spring Cloud Stream applications are launched independently, these properties must be set correctly.
By default, `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` is `1`, and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` is `0`.

In a scaled-up scenario, correct configuration of these two properties is important for addressing partitioning behavior (see below) in general, and the two properties are always required by certain binders (for example, the Kafka binder) in order to ensure that data are split correctly across multiple consumer instances.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-partitioning]]
=== Partitioning

Partitioning in Spring Cloud Stream consists of two tasks:

* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-output-bindings-partitioning>>`
* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-input-bindings-partitioning>>`

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-output-bindings-partitioning]]
==== Configuring Output Bindings for Partitioning

You can configure an output binding to send partitioned data by setting one and only one of its `partitionKeyExpression` or `partitionKeyExtractorName` properties, as well as its `partitionCount` property.

For example, the following is a valid and typical configuration:

----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5
----

Based on that example configuration, data is sent to the target partition by using the following logic.

A partition key's value is calculated for each message sent to a partitioned output channel based on the `partitionKeyExpression`.
The `partitionKeyExpression` is a SpEL expression that is evaluated against the outbound message for extracting the partitioning key.

If a SpEL expression is not sufficient for your needs, you can instead calculate the partition key value by providing an implementation of `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy` and configuring it as a bean (by using the `@Bean` annotation).
If you have more then one bean of type `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy` available in the Application Context, you can further filter it by specifying its name with the `partitionKeyExtractorName` property, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorName=customPartitionKeyExtractor
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5
. . .
@Bean
public CustomPartitionKeyExtractorClass customPartitionKeyExtractor() {
    return new CustomPartitionKeyExtractorClass();
}
----

NOTE: In previous versions of Spring Cloud Stream, you could specify the implementation of `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy` by setting the  `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorClass` property.
Since version 2.0, this property is deprecated, and support for it will be removed in a future version.

Once the message key is calculated, the partition selection process determines the target partition as a value between `0` and `partitionCount - 1`.
The default calculation, applicable in most scenarios, is based on the following formula: `key.hashCode() % partitionCount`.
This can be customized on the binding, either by setting a SpEL expression to be evaluated against the 'key' (through the `partitionSelectorExpression` property) or by configuring an implementation of `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionSelectorStrategy` as a bean (by using the @Bean annotation).
Similar to the `PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy`, you can further filter it by using the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorName` property when more than one bean of this type is available in the Application Context, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorName=customPartitionSelector
. . .
@Bean
public CustomPartitionSelectorClass customPartitionSelector() {
    return new CustomPartitionSelectorClass();
}
----

NOTE: In previous versions of Spring Cloud Stream you could specify the implementation of `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionSelectorStrategy` by setting the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorClass` property.
Since version 2.0, this property is deprecated and support for it will be removed in a future version.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-input-bindings-partitioning]]
==== Configuring Input Bindings for Partitioning

An input binding (with the channel name `input`) is configured to receive partitioned data by setting its `partitioned` property, as well as the `instanceIndex` and `instanceCount` properties on the application itself, as shown in the following example:

----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.partitioned=true
spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex=3
spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount=5
----

The `instanceCount` value represents the total number of application instances between which the data should be partitioned.
The `instanceIndex` must be a unique value across the multiple instances, with a value between `0` and `instanceCount - 1`.
The instance index helps each application instance to identify the unique partition(s) from which it receives data.
It is required by binders using technology that does not support partitioning natively.
For example, with RabbitMQ, there is a queue for each partition, with the queue name containing the instance index.
With Kafka, if `autoRebalanceEnabled` is `true` (default), Kafka takes care of distributing partitions across instances, and these properties are not required.
If `autoRebalanceEnabled` is set to false, the `instanceCount` and `instanceIndex` are used by the binder to determine which partition(s) the instance subscribes to (you must have at least as many partitions as there are instances).
The binder allocates the partitions instead of Kafka.
This might be useful if you want messages for a particular partition to always go to the same instance.
When a binder configuration requires them, it is important to set both values correctly in order to ensure that all of the data is consumed and that the application instances receive mutually exclusive datasets.

While a scenario in which using multiple instances for partitioned data processing may be complex to set up in a standalone case, Spring Cloud Dataflow can simplify the process significantly by populating both the input and output values correctly and by letting you rely on the runtime infrastructure to provide information about the instance index and instance count.

== Testing

Spring Cloud Stream provides support for testing your microservice applications without connecting to a messaging system.
You can do that by using the `TestSupportBinder` provided by the `spring-cloud-stream-test-support` library, which can be added as a test dependency to the application, as shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-test-support</artifactId>
       <scope>test</scope>
   </dependency>
----

NOTE: The `TestSupportBinder` uses the Spring Boot autoconfiguration mechanism to supersede the other binders found on the classpath.
Therefore, when adding a binder as a dependency, you must make sure that the `test` scope is being used.

The `TestSupportBinder` lets you interact with the bound channels and inspect any messages sent and received by the application.

For outbound message channels, the `TestSupportBinder` registers a single subscriber and retains the messages emitted by the application in a `MessageCollector`.
They can be retrieved during tests and have assertions made against them.

You can also send messages to inbound message channels so that the consumer application can consume the messages.
The following example shows how to test both input and output channels on a processor:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment= SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class ExampleTest {

  @Autowired
  private Processor processor;

  @Autowired
  private MessageCollector messageCollector;

  @Test
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  public void testWiring() {
    Message<String> message = new GenericMessage<>("hello");
    processor.input().send(message);
    Message<String> received = (Message<String>) messageCollector.forChannel(processor.output()).poll();
    assertThat(received.getPayload(), equalTo("hello world"));
  }


  @SpringBootApplication
  @EnableBinding(Processor.class)
  public static class MyProcessor {

    @Autowired
    private Processor channels;

    @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
    public String transform(String in) {
      return in + " world";
    }
  }
}
----

In the preceding example, we create an application that has an input channel and an output channel, both bound through the `Processor` interface.
The bound interface is injected into the test so that we can have access to both channels.
We send a message on the input channel, and we use the `MessageCollector` provided by Spring Cloud Stream's test support to capture that the message has been sent to the output channel as a result.
Once we have received the message, we can validate that the component functions correctly.


=== Disabling the Test Binder Autoconfiguration

The intent behind the test binder superseding all the other binders on the classpath is to make it easy to test your applications without making changes to your production dependencies.
In some cases (for example, integration tests) it is useful to use the actual production binders instead, and that requires disabling the test binder autoconfiguration.
To do so, you can exclude the `org.springframework.cloud.stream.test.binder.TestSupportBinderAutoConfiguration` class by using one of the Spring Boot autoconfiguration exclusion mechanisms, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
    @SpringBootApplication(exclude = TestSupportBinderAutoConfiguration.class)
    @EnableBinding(Processor.class)
    public static class MyProcessor {

        @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
        public String transform(String in) {
            return in + " world";
        }
    }
----

When autoconfiguration is disabled, the test binder is available on the classpath, and its `defaultCandidate` property is set to `false` so that it does not interfere with the regular user configuration. It can be referenced under the name, `test`, as shown in the following example:

`spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder=test`

[[spring_integration_test_binder]]
=== Spring Integration Test Binder
Current test binder was specifically designed to facilitate _unit testing_ of the actual messaging components and thus bypasses some of the core functionality of the binder API.
While such light-weight approach is sufficient for a lot of cases, it usually requires additional _integration testing_ with real binders (e.g., Rabbit, Kafka etc).

To begin bridging the gap between _unit_ and _integration_ testing we've developed a new test binder which uses https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration[Spring Integration] framework
as an in-JVM Message Broker essentially giving you the best of both worlds - a real binder without the networking.

To enable Spring Integration Test Binder all you need is:

- Add required dependencies
- Remove the dependency for `spring-cloud-stream-test-support`

***Add required dependencies***

Below is the example of the required Maven POM entries which could be easily retrofitted into Gradle.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream</artifactId>
    <version>${spring.cloud.strea.version}</version>
    <type>test-jar</type>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <classifier>test-binder</classifier>
</dependency>
. . .
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
	    <execution>
		<configuration>
		    <includes>
			 <include>**/integration/*</include>
		    </includes>
		    <classifier>test-binder</classifier>
		</configuration>
                <goals>
                    <goal>test-jar</goal>
                </goals>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
----

***Remove the dependency for `spring-cloud-stream-test-support`***

To avoid conflicts with the existing test binder you must eremove the following entry

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-test-support</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Now you can test your microservice as a simple unit test


[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class DemoTestBinderApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoTestBinderApplication.class, args);
	}

	@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
	@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
	public String echo(String value) {
		return value;
	}
}

. . .

@Test
public void sampleTest() {
	ApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(
					TestChannelBinderConfiguration.class,
					DemoTestBinderApplication.class)
				.web(WebApplicationType.NONE).run();
	InputDestination source = context.getBean(InputDestination.class);
	OutputDestination target = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);
	source.send(new GenericMessage<byte[]>("hello".getBytes()));
	System.out.println("Result: " + new String(target.receive().getPayload()));
}
----

In the above you simply create an ApplicationContext with your configuration (your application) while additionally supplying `TestChannelBinderConfiguration`
provided by the framework. Then you access `InputDestination` and `OutputDestination` beans to send/receive messages. In the context of this binder
`InputDestination` and `OutputDestination` emulate remote destinations such as Rabbit _exchange/queue_ or Kafka _topic_.

In the future we plan to simplify the API.

NOTE: In its current state Spring Integration Test Binder only supports the three bindings provided by the framework (Source, Processor, Sink) specifically to promote
light-weight microservices architectures rather then general purpose messaging applications.

==== Spring Integration Test Binder and PollableMessageSource
Spring Integration Test Binder also allows you to write tests when working with `PollableMessageSource` (see <<Using Polled Consumers>> for more details).

The important thing that needs to be understood though is that polling is not event-driven, and that `PollableMessageSource` is a strategy which exposes operation to produce (poll for) a Message (singular).
How often you poll or how many threads you use or where you're polling from (message queue or file system) is entirely up to you;
In other words it is your responsibility to configure Poller or Threads or the actual source of Message. Luckily Spring has plenty of abstractions to configure exactly that.

Let's look at the example:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void samplePollingTest() {
	ApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(SamplePolledConfiguration.class)
				.web(WebApplicationType.NONE)
				.run("--spring.jmx.enabled=false");
	OutputDestination destination = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);
	System.out.println("Message 1: " + new String(destination.receive().getPayload()));
	System.out.println("Message 2: " + new String(destination.receive().getPayload()));
	System.out.println("Message 3: " + new String(destination.receive().getPayload()));
}

@EnableBinding(SamplePolledConfiguration.PolledConsumer.class)
@Import(TestChannelBinderConfiguration.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class SamplePolledConfiguration {
	@Bean
	public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource polledMessageSource, MessageChannel output, TaskExecutor taskScheduler) {
		return args -> {
			taskScheduler.execute(() -> {
				for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
					try {
						if (!polledMessageSource.poll(m -> {
							String newPayload = ((String) m.getPayload()).toUpperCase();
							output.send(new GenericMessage<>(newPayload));
						})) {
							Thread.sleep(2000);
						}
					}
					catch (Exception e) {
						// handle failure
					}
				}
			});
		};
	}

	public static interface PolledConsumer extends Source {
		@Input
		PollableMessageSource pollableSource();
	}
}
----

The above (very rudimentary) example will produce 3 messages in 2 second intervals sending them to the output destination of `Source`
which this binder sends to `OutputDestination` where we retrieve them (for any assertions).
Currently it prints the following:
[source, text]
----
Message 1: POLLED DATA
Message 2: POLLED DATA
Message 3: POLLED DATA
----
As you can see the data is the same. That is because this binder defines a default implementation of the actual `MessageSource` - the source
from which the Messages are polled using `poll()` operation. While sufficient for most testing scenarios, there are cases where you may want
to define your own `MessageSource`. To do so simply configure a bean of type `MessageSource` in your test configuration providing your own
implementation of Message sourcing.

Here is the example:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public MessageSource<?> source() {
	return () -> new GenericMessage<>("My Own Data " + UUID.randomUUID());
}
----
rendering the following output;
[source, text]
----
Message 1: MY OWN DATA 1C180A91-E79F-494F-ABF4-BA3F993710DA
Message 2: MY OWN DATA D8F3A477-5547-41B4-9434-E69DA7616FEE
Message 3: MY OWN DATA 20BF2E64-7FF4-4CB6-A823-4053D30B5C74
----

NOTE: DO NOT name this bean `messageSource` as it is going to be in conflict with the bean of the same name (different type)
provided by Spring Boot for unrelated reasons.


== Health Indicator

Spring Cloud Stream provides a health indicator for binders.
It is registered under the name `binders` and can be enabled or disabled by setting the `management.health.binders.enabled` property.

To enable health check you first need to enable both "web" and "actuator" by including its dependencies (see <<binding_visualization_control>>)

If `management.health.binders.enabled` is not set explicitly by the application, then `management.health.defaults.enabled` is matched as `true` and the binder health indicators are enabled.
If you want to disable health indicator completely, then you have to set `management.health.binders.enabled` to `false`.

You can use Spring Boot actuator health endpoint to access the health indicator - `/actuator/health`.
By default, you will only receive the top level application status when you hit the above endpoint.
In order to receive the full details from the binder specific health indicators, you need to include the property `management.endpoint.health.show-details` with the value `ALWAYS` in your application.

Health indicators are binder-specific and certain binder implementations may not necessarily provide a health indicator.

If you want to completely disable all health indicators available out of the box and instead provide your own health indicators,
you can do so by setting property `management.health.binders.enabled` to `false` and then provide your own `HealthIndicator` beans in your application.
In this case, the health indicator infrastructure from Spring Boot will still pick up these custom beans.
Even if you are not disabling the binder health indicators, you can still enhance the health checks by providing your own `HealthIndicator` beans in addition to the out of the box health checks.

When you have multiple binders in the same application, health indicators are enabled by default unless the application turns them off by setting `management.health.binders.enabled` to `false`.
In this case, if the user wants to disable health check for a subset of the binders, then that should be done by setting `management.health.binders.enabled` to `false` in the multi binder configurations's environment.
See <<multiple-systems,Connecting to Multiple Systems>> for details on how environment specific properties can be provided.

If there are multiple binders present in the classpath but not all of them are used in the application, this may cause some issues in the context of health indicators.
There may be implementation specific details as to how the health checks are performed. For example, a Kafka binder may decide the status as `DOWN` if there are no destinations registered by the binder.
For this reason, if you include a binder in the classpath, it is advised to use that binder by providing at least one binding (for E.g. through `EnableBinding`).
If you don't have any bindings to provide for this binder, then that is an indication that you don't need to include that binder in the classpath.

Lets take a concrete situation. Imagine you have both Kafka and Kafka Streams binders present in the classpath, but only use the Kafka Streams binder in the application code, i.e. only provide bindings using the Kafka Streams binder.
Since Kafka binder is not used and it has specific checks to see if any destinations are registered, the binder health heck will fail.
The top level application health check status will be reported as `DOWN`.
In this situation, you can simply remove the dependency for kafka binder from your application since you are not using it.

== Metrics Emitter

Spring Boot Actuator provides dependency management and auto-configuration for https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer], an application metrics
facade that supports numerous https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics[monitoring systems].

Spring Cloud Stream provides support for emitting any available micrometer-based metrics to a binding destination, allowing for periodic
collection of metric data from stream applications without relying on polling individual endpoints.

Metrics Emitter is activated by defining the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination` property,
which specifies the name of the binding destination used by the current binder to publish metric messages.

For example:
[source,java]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=myMetricDestination
----
The preceding example instructs the binder to bind to `myMetricDestination` (that is, Rabbit exchange, Kafka topic, and others).

The following properties can be used for customizing the emission of metrics:

spring.cloud.stream.metrics.key::
The name of the metric being emitted. Should be a unique value per application.
+
Default: `${spring.application.name:${vcap.application.name:${spring.config.name:application}}}`
+
spring.cloud.stream.metrics.properties::
Allows white listing application properties that are added to the metrics payload
+
Default: null.
+
spring.cloud.stream.metrics.meter-filter::
Pattern to control the 'meters' one wants to capture.
For example, specifying `spring.integration.*` captures metric information for meters whose name starts with `spring.integration.`
+
Default: all 'meters' are captured.
+
spring.cloud.stream.metrics.schedule-interval::
Interval to control the rate of publishing metric data.
+
Default: 1 min

Consider the following:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar time-source.jar \
    --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.applicationMetrics.destination=someMetrics \
    --spring.cloud.stream.metrics.properties=spring.application** \
    --spring.cloud.stream.metrics.meter-filter=spring.integration.*
----

The following example shows the payload of the data published to the binding destination as a result of the preceding command:

[source,javascript]
----
{
	"name": "application",
	"createdTime": "2018-03-23T14:48:12.700Z",
	"properties": {
	},
	"metrics": [
		{
			"id": {
				"name": "spring.integration.send",
				"tags": [
					{
						"key": "exception",
						"value": "none"
					},
					{
						"key": "name",
						"value": "input"
					},
					{
						"key": "result",
						"value": "success"
					},
					{
						"key": "type",
						"value": "channel"
					}
				],
				"type": "TIMER",
				"description": "Send processing time",
				"baseUnit": "milliseconds"
			},
			"timestamp": "2018-03-23T14:48:12.697Z",
			"sum": 130.340546,
			"count": 6,
			"mean": 21.72342433333333,
			"upper": 116.176299,
			"total": 130.340546
		}
	]
}
----

NOTE: Given that the format of the Metric message has slightly changed after migrating to Micrometer, the published message will also have
a `STREAM_CLOUD_STREAM_VERSION` header set to `2.x` to help distinguish between Metric messages from the older versions of the Spring Cloud Stream.

== Samples

For Spring Cloud Stream samples, see the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-samples[spring-cloud-stream-samples] repository on GitHub.

=== Deploying Stream Applications on CloudFoundry

On CloudFoundry, services are usually exposed through a special environment variable called https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES[VCAP_SERVICES].

When configuring your binder connections, you can use the values from an environment variable as explained on the http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-ups[dataflow Cloud Foundry Server] docs.
