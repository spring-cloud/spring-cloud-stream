== Introducing Spring Cloud Stream

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications.
Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers.
It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.

By simply adding spring-cloud-stream dependencies to the classpath of your application you'll get immediate connectivity
to a message broker exposed via provided spring-cloud-stream binder (more on hat later), and you can implement your functional
requirement that will be executed based on the incoming message using simple `java.util.function.Function`

Here is the quick example:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SampleApplication.class, args);
	}

    @Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	    return value -> value.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----

and corresponding test

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest(classes =  SampleApplication.class)
@Import({TestChannelBinderConfiguration.class})
class BootTestStreamApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private InputDestination input;

	@Autowired
	private OutputDestination output;

	@Test
	void contextLoads() {
		input.send(new GenericMessage<byte[]>("hello".getBytes()));
		assertThat(output.receive().getPayload()).isEqualTo("HELLO".getBytes());
	}
}
----

== Main Concepts

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-application-model]]
=== Application Model

A Spring Cloud Stream application consists of a middleware-neutral core.
The application communicates with the outside world by establishing _bindings_ between destinations
exposed by the external brokers and input/output arguments in your code. Broker specific details
necessary to establish bindings are handled by middleware-specific _Binder_ implementations.

.Spring Cloud Stream Application

==== Fat JAR

Spring Cloud Stream applications can be run in stand-alone mode from your IDE for testing.
To run a Spring Cloud Stream application in production, you can create an executable (or "`fat`") JAR by using the standard Spring Boot tooling provided for Maven or Gradle. See the  https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-build.html#howto-create-an-executable-jar-with-maven[Spring Boot Reference Guide] for more details.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-binder-abstraction]]
=== The Binder Abstraction

Spring Cloud Stream provides Binder implementations for https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka[Kafka] and https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit[Rabbit MQ].
The framework also includes a test binder for integration testing of your applications as spring-cloud-stream application. See <<Testing>> section for more details.

Binder abstraction is also one of the extension points of the framework, which means you can implement your own binder on top of Spring Cloud Stream.
The https://medium.com/@domenicosibilio/how-to-create-a-spring-cloud-stream-binder-from-scratch-ab8b29ee931b[How to create a Spring Cloud Stream Binder from scratch] post a community member documents
in details with example a set of steps necessary to implement custom binder.

Spring Cloud Stream uses Spring Boot for configuration, and the Binder abstraction makes it possible for a Spring Cloud Stream application to be flexible in how it connects to middleware.
For example, deployers can dynamically choose, at runtime, the mapping between the external destinations (such as the Kafka topics or RabbitMQ exchanges) and inputs
and outputs of the message handler (such as input parameter of the function and its return argument).
Such configuration can be provided through external configuration properties and in any form supported by Spring Boot (including application arguments, environment variables, and `application.yml` or `application.properties` files).
In the sink example from the <<spring-cloud-stream-overview-introducing>> section, setting the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination` application property to `raw-sensor-data` causes it to read from the `raw-sensor-data` Kafka topic or from a queue bound to the `raw-sensor-data` RabbitMQ exchange.

Spring Cloud Stream automatically detects and uses a binder found on the classpath.
You can use different types of middleware with the same code.
To do so, include a different binder at build time.
For more complex use cases, you can also package multiple binders with your application and have it choose the binder( and even whether to use different binders for different bindings) at runtime.


[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-persistent-publish-subscribe-support]]
=== Persistent Publish-Subscribe Support

Communication between applications follows a publish-subscribe model, where data is broadcast through shared topics.
This can be seen in the following figure, which shows a typical deployment for a set of interacting Spring Cloud Stream applications.

.Spring Cloud Stream Publish-Subscribe
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/SCSt-sensors.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

Data reported by sensors to an HTTP endpoint is sent to a common destination named `raw-sensor-data`.
From the destination, it is independently processed by a microservice application that computes time-windowed averages and by another microservice application that ingests the raw data into HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
In order to process the data, both applications declare the topic as their input at runtime.

The publish-subscribe communication model reduces the complexity of both the producer and the consumer and lets new applications be added to the topology without disruption of the existing flow.
For example, downstream from the average-calculating application, you can add an application that calculates the highest temperature values for display and monitoring.
You can then add another application that interprets the same flow of averages for fault detection.
Doing all communication through shared topics rather than point-to-point queues reduces coupling between microservices.

While the concept of publish-subscribe messaging is not new, Spring Cloud Stream takes the extra step of making it an opinionated choice for its application model.
By using native middleware support, Spring Cloud Stream also simplifies use of the publish-subscribe model across different platforms.

[[consumer-groups]]
=== Consumer Groups
While the publish-subscribe model makes it easy to connect applications through shared topics, the ability to scale up by creating multiple instances of a given application is equally important.
When doing so, different instances of an application are placed in a competing consumer relationship, where only one of the instances is expected to handle a given message.

Spring Cloud Stream models this behavior through the concept of a consumer group.
(Spring Cloud Stream consumer groups are similar to and inspired by Kafka consumer groups.)
Each consumer binding can use the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<bindingName>.group` property to specify a group name.
For the consumers shown in the following figure, this property would be set as `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<bindingName>.group=hdfsWrite` or `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<bindingName>.group=average`.

.Spring Cloud Stream Consumer Groups
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/SCSt-groups.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

All groups that subscribe to a given destination receive a copy of published data, but only one member of each group receives a given message from that destination.
By default, when a group is not specified, Spring Cloud Stream assigns the application to an anonymous and independent single-member consumer group that is in a publish-subscribe relationship with all other consumer groups.

[[consumer-types]]
=== Consumer Types

Two types of consumer are supported:

* Message-driven (sometimes referred to as Asynchronous)
* Polled (sometimes referred to as Synchronous)

Prior to version 2.0, only asynchronous consumers were supported. A message is delivered as soon as it is available and a thread is available to process it.

When you wish to control the rate at which messages are processed, you might want to use a synchronous consumer.
// TODO This needs more description. A sentence parallel to the last sentence of the preceding paragraph would help.

[[durability]]
==== Durability

Consistent with the opinionated application model of Spring Cloud Stream, consumer group subscriptions are durable.
That is, a binder implementation ensures that group subscriptions are persistent and that, once at least one subscription for a group has been created, the group receives messages, even if they are sent while all applications in the group are stopped.

[NOTE]
====
Anonymous subscriptions are non-durable by nature.
For some binder implementations (such as RabbitMQ), it is possible to have non-durable group subscriptions.
====

In general, it is preferable to always specify a consumer group when binding an application to a given destination.
When scaling up a Spring Cloud Stream application, you must specify a consumer group for each of its input bindings.
Doing so prevents the application's instances from receiving duplicate messages (unless that behavior is desired, which is unusual).

[[partitioning]]
=== Partitioning Support

Spring Cloud Stream provides support for partitioning data between multiple instances of a given application.
In a partitioned scenario, the physical communication medium (such as the broker topic) is viewed as being structured into multiple partitions.
One or more producer application instances send data to multiple consumer application instances and ensure that data identified by common characteristics are processed by the same consumer instance.

Spring Cloud Stream provides a common abstraction for implementing partitioned processing use cases in a uniform fashion.
Partitioning can thus be used whether the broker itself is naturally partitioned (for example, Kafka) or not (for example, RabbitMQ).

.Spring Cloud Stream Partitioning
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/SCSt-partitioning.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

Partitioning is a critical concept in stateful processing, where it is critical (for either performance or consistency reasons) to ensure that all related data is processed together.
For example, in the time-windowed average calculation example, it is important that all measurements from any given sensor are processed by the same application instance.

NOTE: To set up a partitioned processing scenario, you must configure both the data-producing and the data-consuming ends.

== Programming Model

To understand the programming model, you should be familiar with the following core concepts:

* *Destination Binders:* Components responsible to provide integration with the external messaging systems.
* *Bindings:* Bridge between the external messaging systems and application provided _Producers_ and _Consumers_ of messages (created by the Destination Binders).
* *Message:* The canonical data structure used by producers and consumers to communicate with Destination Binders (and thus other applications via external messaging systems).

image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/SCSt-overview.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

=== Destination Binders

Destination Binders are extension components of Spring Cloud Stream responsible for providing the necessary configuration and implementation to facilitate
integration with external messaging systems.
This integration is responsible for connectivity, delegation, and routing of messages to and from producers and consumers, data type conversion,
invocation of the user code, and more.

Binders handle a lot of the boiler plate responsibilities that would otherwise fall on your shoulders. However, to accomplish that, the binder still needs
some help in the form of minimalistic yet required set of instructions from the user, which typically come in the form of some type of _binding_ configuration.

While it is out of scope of this section to discuss all of the available binder and binding configuration options (the rest of the manual covers them extensively),
_Binding_ as a concept, does require special attention. The next section discusses it in detail.

=== Bindings

As stated earlier, _Bindings_ provide a bridge between the external messaging system (e.g., queue, topic etc.) and application-provided _Producers_ and _Consumers_.

The following example shows a fully configured and functioning Spring Cloud Stream application that receives the payload of the message
as a `String` type (see <<Content Type Negotiation>> section), logs it to the console and sends it down stream after converting it to upper case.

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SampleApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	    return value -> {
	        System.out.println("Received: " + value);
	        return value.toUpperCase()
	    };
	}
}
----
Unlike previous versions of spring-cloud-stream which relied on `@EnableBinding` and `@StreamListener` annotations,
the above example looks no different then any vanilla spring-boot application. It defines a single bean of type `Function`
and that it is. So, how does it became spring-cloud-stream application?
It becomes spring-cloud-stream application simply based on the presence of spring-cloud-stream and binder dependencies
and auto-configuration classes on the classpath effectively setting the context for your boot application as spring-cloud-stream application.
And in this context beans of type `Supplier`, `Function` or `Consumer` are treated as defacto message handlers triggering
binding of to destinations exposed by the provided binder following certain naming conventions and
rules to avoid extra configuration.

==== Binding and Binding names

Binding is an abstraction that represents a bridge between sources and targets exposed by the binder and user code,
This abstraction has a name and while we try to do our best to limit configuration required to run spring-cloud-stream applications,
being aware of such name(s) is necessary for cases where additional per-binding configuration is required.

Throughout this manual you will see examples of configuration properties such as `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=myQueue`.
The `input` segment in this property name is what we refer to as _binding name_ and it could derive via several mechanisms.
The following sub-sections will describe the naming conventions and configuration elements used by spring-cloud-stream to control binding names.

===== Functional binding names

Unlike the explicit naming required by annotation-based support (legacy) used in the previous versions of spring-cloud-stream, the functional
programming model defaults to a simple convention when it comes to binding names, thus greatly simplifying application configuration.
Let's look at the first example:

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	    return value -> value.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----

In the preceding example we have an application with a single function which acts as message handler. As a `Function` it has an
input and output.
The naming convention used to name input and output bindings is as follows:

* input - `<functionName> + -in- + <index>`
* output - `<functionName> + -out- + <index>`

The `in` and `out` corresponds to the type of binding (such as _input_ or _output_).
The `index` is the index of the input or output binding. It is always 0 for typical single input/output function,
so it's only relevant for <<Functions with multiple input and output arguments>>.

So if for example you would want to map the input of this function to a remote
destination (e.g., topic, queue etc) called "my-topic" you would do so with the following property:
----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.destination=my-topic
----
Note how `uppercase-in-0` is used as a segment in property name. The same goes for `uppercase-out-0`.

***Descriptive Binding Names***

Some times to improve readability you may want to give your binding a more descriptive name (such as 'account', 'orders` etc).
Another way of looking at it is you can map an _implicit binding name_ to an _explicit binding name_. And you can do it with
`spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.<binding-name>` property.
This property also provides a migration path for existing applications that rely on custom interface-based
bindings that require explicit names.

For example,
----
--spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.uppercase-in-0=input`
----

In the preceding example you mapped and effectively renamed `uppercase-in-0` binding name to `input`. Now all configuration
properties can refer to `input` binding name instead (e.g.,  `--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=my-topic`).

NOTE: While descriptive binding names may enhance the readability aspect of the configuration, they also create
another level of misdirection by mapping an implicit binding name to an explicit binding name. And since all subsequent
configuration properties will use the explicit binding name you must always refer to this 'bindings' property to
correlate which function it actually corresponds to. We believe that for most cases (with the exception of <<Functional Composition>>)
it may be an overkill, so, it is our recommendation to avoid using it all together, especially
since not using it provides a clear path between binder destination and binding name, such as `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.destination=sample-topic`,
where you are clearly correlating the input of `uppercase` function to `sample-topic` destination.

For more on properties and other configuration options please see <<Configuration Options>> section.


===== Annotation-based binding names (legacy)

In previous versions of spring-cloud-stream _binding_ names and in fact implementations, derived from the `@EnableBinding`
annotation which typically would take one or more interface classes as parameters. The parameters are referred to
as _bindings_, and they contain methods representing _bindable components_.

For compliance with legacy style applications we still support this annotation-based programming model and you can get more information about it in
<<Annotation-based support (legacy)>> section (sub-section of the <<Programming Model>> section).

Spring Cloud Stream already provides _binding_ interfaces for typical message exchange contracts, which include:

* *Sink:* Identifies the contract for the message consumer by providing the destination from which the message is consumed.
* *Source:* Identifies the contract for the message producer by providing the destination to which the produced message is sent.
* *Processor:* Encapsulates both the sink and the source contracts by exposing two destinations that allow consumption and production of messages.

[source, java]
----
public interface Sink {

  String INPUT = "input";

  @Input(Sink.INPUT)
  SubscribableChannel input();
}
----

[source, java]
----
public interface Source {

  String OUTPUT = "output";

  @Output(Source.OUTPUT)
  MessageChannel output();
}
----

[source, java]
----
public interface Processor extends Source, Sink {}
----

And you can define your own interfaces as well
[source, java]
----
public interface MyBinding {

  String FOO = "foo";

  @Output(MyBinding.FOO)
  MessageChannel foo();
}
----

NOTE: The reason why `@EnableBinding` and binding interfaces are not required with functional programming model is because
they could be derived from the type of functional interface itself. For example, _Processor = Function_, _Source = Supplier_
and so on.


*Pollable Destination Binding*

While the previously described bindings support event-based message consumption, sometimes you need more control, such as rate of consumption.

Starting with version 2.0, you can now bind a pollable consumer:

The following example shows how to bind a pollable consumer:

[source, java]
----
public interface PolledBarista {

    @Input
    PollableMessageSource orders();
	. . .
}
----

In this case, an implementation of `PollableMessageSource` is bound to the `orders` “channel”. See <<Using Polled Consumers>> for more details.


[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-producing-consuming-messages]]
=== Producing and Consuming Messages

You can write a Spring Cloud Stream application by simply writing functions and exposing them as `@Bean`s.
You can also use Spring Integration annotations based configuration or
Spring Cloud Stream annotation based configuration, although starting with spring-cloud-stream 3.x
we recommend using functional implementations.

[[spring_cloud_function]]
==== Spring Cloud Function support

===== Overview

Since Spring Cloud Stream v2.1, another alternative for defining _stream handlers_ and _sources_ is to use build-in
support for https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-function/[Spring Cloud Function] where they can be expressed as beans of
 type `java.util.function.[Supplier/Function/Consumer]`.

To specify which functional bean to bind to the external destination(s) exposed by the bindings,
you must provide `spring.cloud.function.definition` property.

NOTE: In the event you only have single bean of type `java.util.function.[Supplier/Function/Consumer]`, you can
skip the `spring.cloud.function.definition` property, since such functional bean will be auto-discovered. However,
it is considered best practice to use such property to avoid any confusion.

Here is the example of the application exposing message handler as `java.util.function.Function` effectively supporting
_pass-thru_ semantics by acting as consumer and producer of data.
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyFunctionBootApp {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(MyFunctionBootApp.class);
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> toUpperCase() {
		return s -> s.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----
In the preceding example, we define a bean of type `java.util.function.Function` called _toUpperCase_ to be acting as message handler
whose 'input' and 'output' must be bound to the external destinations exposed by the provided destination binder.
By default the 'input' and 'output' binding names will be `toUpperCase-in-0` and `toUpperCase-out-0`.
Please see <<Functional binding names>> section for details on naming convention used to establish binding names.

Below are the examples of simple functional applications to support other semantics:

Here is the example of a _source_ semantics exposed as `java.util.function.Supplier`
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SourceFromSupplier {

	@Bean
	public Supplier<Date> date() {
		return () -> new Date(12345L);
	}
}
----

Here is the example of a _sink semantics_ exposed as `java.util.function.Consumer`
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SinkFromConsumer {

	@Bean
	public Consumer<String> sink() {
		return System.out::println;
	}
}
----

===== Suppliers (Sources)

`Function` and `Consumer` are pretty straightforward when it comes to how their invocation is triggered. They are triggered based
on data (events) sent to the destination they are bound to. In other words, they are classic event-driven components.

However, `Supplier` is in its own category when it comes to triggering. Since it is, by definition, the source (the origin) of the data, it does not
subscribe to any in-bound destination and, therefore, has to be triggered by some other mechanism(s).
There is also a question of `Supplier` implementation, which could be _imperative_ or _reactive_ and which directly relates to the triggering of such suppliers.

Consider the following sample:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SupplierConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public Supplier<String> stringSupplier() {
		return () -> "Hello from Supplier";
	}
}
----

The preceding `Supplier` bean produces a string whenever its `get()` method is invoked. However, who invokes this method and how often?
The framework provides a default polling mechanism (answering the question of "Who?") that will trigger the invocation of the supplier and by default it will do so
every second (answering the question of "How often?").
In other words, the above configuration produces a single message every second and each message is sent to an `output` destination that is exposed by the binder.
To learn how to customize the polling mechanism, see <<Polling Configuration Properties>> section.

Consider a different sample:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SupplierConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public Supplier<Flux<String>> stringSupplier() {
		return () -> Flux.from(emitter -> {
			while (true) {
				try {
					emitter.onNext("Hello from Supplier");
					Thread.sleep(1000);
				} catch (Exception e) {
					// ignore
				}
			}
		});
	}
}
----

The preceding `Supplier` bean adopts the reactive programming style. Typically, and unlike the imperative supplier,
it should be triggered only once, given that the invocation of its `get()` method produces (supplies) the continuous stream of messages and not an
individual message.

The framework recognizes the difference in the programming style and guarantees that such a supplier is triggered only once.

However, imagine the use case where you want to poll some data source and return a finite stream of data representing the result set.
The reactive programming style is a perfect mechanism for such a Supplier. However, given the finite nature of the produced stream,
such Supplier still needs to be invoked periodically.

Consider the following sample, which emulates such use case by producing a finite stream of data:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SupplierConfiguration {

	@PollableBean
	public Supplier<Flux<String>> stringSupplier() {
		return () -> Flux.just("hello", "bye");
	}
}
----

The bean itself is annotated with `PollableBean` annotation (sub-set of `@Bean`), thus signaling to the framework that although the implementation
of such a supplier is reactive, it still needs to be polled.

NOTE: There is a `splittable` attribute defined in `PollableBean` which signals to the post processors of this annotation
that the result produced by the annotated component has to be split and is set to `true` by default. It means that
the framework will split the returning sending out each item as an individual message. If this is not
he desired behavior you can set it to `false` at which point such supplier will simply return
the produced Flux without splitting it.


====== Polling Configuration Properties

The following properties are exposed by `org.springframework.cloud.stream.config.DefaultPollerProperties` and are prefixed with
`spring.cloud.stream.poller`:

fixedDelay::
Fixed delay for default poller in milliseconds.
+
Default: 1000L.

maxMessagesPerPoll::
Maximum messages for each polling event of the default poller.
+
Default: 1L.

For example `--spring.cloud.stream.poller.fixed-delay=2000` sets the poller interval to poll every two seconds.

===== Foreign event-driven sources

There are cases where the actual source of data may be coming from outside system that is not a binder. For example, the
source of the data may be a classic web endpoint. How do we bridge such source with the functional Supplier?

Let's look at a simple example:

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@Controller
public class WebSourceApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(WebSourceApplication.class);
	}

	EmitterProcessor<String> processor = EmitterProcessor.create();

	@RequestMapping
	@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
	public void delegateToSupplier(@RequestBody String body) {
		processor.onNext(body);
	}

	@Bean
	public Supplier<Flux<String>> supplier() {
		return () -> processor;
	}
}
----

Here you see a standard MVC endpoint method called `delegateToSupplier` bound to the root web context and a `Supplier` bean. Note how `Supplier` bean returns `Flux` of `Strings`.
Yes we are benefiting from the reactive support (see <<Reactive Functions support>> for more details). Specifically
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/EmitterProcessor.html[EmitterProcessor] which effectively serves as bridge
between the web and spring-cloud-stream.  As you can see in the endpoint method, all we do is call `onNext(..)` operation of the `EmitterProcessor`
with the value of the HTTP request's body. From that point on the Supplier rules described earlier apply.

You can now send message to spring-cloud-stream source as

----
curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -X POST -d "hello from the other side" http://localhost:8080/
----

And while this example demonstrates bridging web endpoint with the Supplier of data that will be fed into spring-cloud-stream framework,
the approach can be used with other type of foreign sources.

===== Reactive Functions support


Since _Spring Cloud Function_ is build on top of https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor] there isn't much you need to do
to benefit from reactive programming model while implementing `Supplier`, `Function` or `Consumer`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SinkFromConsumer {

	@Bean
	public Function<Flux<String>, Flux<String>> reactiveUpperCase() {
		return flux -> flux.map(val -> val.toUpperCase());
	}
}
----
===== Functional Composition

Using functional programming model you can also benefit from functional composition where you can dynamically compose complex handlers from a set of simple functions.
As an example let's add the following function bean to the application defined above
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Function<String, String> wrapInQuotes() {
	return s -> "\"" + s + "\"";
}
----
and modify the `spring.cloud.function.definition` property to reflect your intention to compose a new function from both ‘toUpperCase’ and ‘wrapInQuotes’.
To do so Spring Cloud Function relies on `|` (pipe) symbol. So, to finish our example our property will now look like this:

[source,java]
----
--spring.cloud.function.definition=toUpperCase|wrapInQuotes
----

NOTE: One of the great benefits of functional composition support provided by _Spring Cloud Function_ is
the fact that you can compose _reactive_ and _imperative_ functions.

The result of a composition is a single function which, as you may guess, could have a very long and rather cryptic name (e.g., `foo|bar|baz|xyz. . .`)
presenting a great deal of inconvenience when it comes to other configuration properties. This is where _descriptive binding names_
feature described in <<Functional binding names>> section can help.

For example, if we want to give our `toUpperCase|wrapInQuotes` a more descriptive name we can do so
with the following property `spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.toUpperCase|wrapInQuotes=quotedUpperCase` allowing
other configuration properties to refer to that binding name (e.g., `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.quotedUpperCase.destination=myDestination`).

===== Functions with multiple input and output arguments

Starting with version 3.0 spring-cloud-stream provides support for functions that
have multiple inputs and/or multiple outputs (return values). What does this actually mean and
what type of use cases it is targeting?

* _Big Data: Imagine the source of data you're dealing with is highly un-organized and contains various types of data elements
(e.g., orders, transactions etc) and you effectively need to sort it out._
* _Data aggregation: Another use case may require you to merge data elements from 2+ incoming _streams_.

The above describes just a few use cases where you may need to use a single function to accept and/or produce
multiple _streams_ of data. And that is the type of use cases we are targeting here.

Also, note a slightly different emphasis on the concept of _streams_ here. The assumption is that such functions are only valuable
if they are given access to the actual streams of data (not the individual elements). So for that we are relying on
abstractions provided by https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor] (i.e., `Flux` and `Mono`) which is already available on the
classpath as part of the dependencies brought in by spring-cloud-functions.

Another important aspect is representation of multiple input and outputs. While java provides
variety of different abstractions to represent _multiple of something_ those abstractions
are _a) unbounded_,  _b) lack arity_ and _c) lack type information_ which are all important in this context.
As an example, let's look at `Collection` or an array which only allows us to
describe _multiple_ of a single type or up-cast everything to an `Object`, affecting transparent type conversion feature of
spring-cloud-stream and so on.

So to accommodate all these requirements the initial support is relying on he signature which utilizes another abstraction
provided by _Project Reactor_ - Tuples. However, we are working on allowing a more flexible signatures.

IMPORTANT: Please refer to <<Binding and Binding names>> section to understand the naming convention used to establish _binding names_
used by such application.

Let's look at the few samples:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	@Bean
	public Function<Tuple2<Flux<String>, Flux<Integer>>, Flux<String>> gather() {
		return tuple -> {
			Flux<String> stringStream = tuple.getT1();
			Flux<String> intStream = tuple.getT2().map(i -> String.valueOf(i));
			return Flux.merge(stringStream, intStream);
		};
	}
}
----

The above example demonstrates function which takes two inputs (first of type `String` and second of type `Integer`)
and produces a single output of type `String`.

So, for the above example the two input bindings will be `gather-in-0` and `gather-in-1` and for consistency the
output binding also follows the same convention and is named `gather-out-0`.


Knowing that will allow you to set binding specific properties the same way you did with `@StreamListener`.
For example, the following will override content-type for `gather-in-0` binding:

----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.gather-in-0.content-type=text/plain
----


[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	@Bean
	public static Function<Flux<Integer>, Tuple2<Flux<String>, Flux<String>>> scatter() {
		return flux -> {
			Flux<Integer> connectedFlux = flux.publish().autoConnect(2);
			UnicastProcessor even = UnicastProcessor.create();
			UnicastProcessor odd = UnicastProcessor.create();
			Flux<Integer> evenFlux = connectedFlux.filter(number -> number % 2 == 0).doOnNext(number -> even.onNext("EVEN: " + number));
			Flux<Integer> oddFlux = connectedFlux.filter(number -> number % 2 != 0).doOnNext(number -> odd.onNext("ODD: " + number));

			return Tuples.of(Flux.from(even).doOnSubscribe(x -> evenFlux.subscribe()), Flux.from(odd).doOnSubscribe(x -> oddFlux.subscribe()));
		};
	}
}
----

The above example is somewhat of a the opposite from the previous sample and  demonstrates function which
takes single input of type `Integer` and produces two outputs (both of type `String`).

So, for the above example the input binding is `gather-in-0` and the
output bindings are `gather-out-0` and `gather-out-1`.

And you test it with the following code:
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testSingleInputMultiOutput() {
	try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(
			TestChannelBinderConfiguration.getCompleteConfiguration(
					SampleApplication.class))
							.run("--spring.cloud.function.definition=scatter")) {
		context.getBean(InputDestination.class);

		InputDestination inputDestination = context.getBean(InputDestination.class);
		OutputDestination outputDestination = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);

		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			inputDestination.send(MessageBuilder.withPayload(String.valueOf(i).getBytes()).build());
		}

		int counter = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
			Message<byte[]> even = outputDestination.receive(0, 0);
			assertThat(even.getPayload()).isEqualTo(("EVEN: " + String.valueOf(counter++)).getBytes());
			Message<byte[]> odd = outputDestination.receive(0, 1);
			assertThat(odd.getPayload()).isEqualTo(("ODD: " + String.valueOf(counter++)).getBytes());
		}
	}
}
----

===== Multiple functions in a single application

There may also be a need for grouping several message handlers in a single application. You would do so by
defining several functions.

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
		return value -> value.toUpperCase();
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> reverse() {
		return value -> new StringBuilder(value).reverse().toString();
	}
}
----

In the above example we have configuration which defines two functions `uppercase` and `reverse`.
So first, as mentioned before, we need to notice that there is a a conflict (more then one function) and therefore
we need to resolve it by providing `spring.cloud.function.definition` property pointing to the actual function
we want to bind. Except here we will use `;` delimiter to point to both functions (see test case below).


IMPORTANT: As with functions with multiple inputs/outputs, please refer to <<Binding and Binding names>> section to understand the naming
convention used to establish _binding names_ used by such application.

And you test it with the following code:
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testMultipleFunctions() {
	try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(
			TestChannelBinderConfiguration.getCompleteConfiguration(
					ReactiveFunctionConfiguration.class))
							.run("--spring.cloud.function.definition=uppercase;reverse")) {
		context.getBean(InputDestination.class);

		InputDestination inputDestination = context.getBean(InputDestination.class);
		OutputDestination outputDestination = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);

		Message<byte[]> inputMessage = MessageBuilder.withPayload("Hello".getBytes()).build();
		inputDestination.send(inputMessage, 0);
		inputDestination.send(inputMessage, 1);

		Message<byte[]> outputMessage = outputDestination.receive(0, 0);
		assertThat(outputMessage.getPayload()).isEqualTo("HELLO".getBytes());

		outputMessage = outputDestination.receive(0, 1);
		assertThat(outputMessage.getPayload()).isEqualTo("olleH".getBytes());
	}
}
----

===== Batch Consumers

When using a `MessageChannelBinder` that supports batch listeners, and the feature is enabled for the consumer binding, you can set `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.batch-mode` to `true` to enable the
entire batch of messages to be passed to the function in a `List`.

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Function<List<Person>, Person> findFirstPerson() {
    return persons -> persons.get(0);
}
----

===== Spring Integration flow as functions
When you implement a function, you may have complex requirements that fit the category
of https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com[Enterprise Integration Patterns] (EIP). These are best handled by using a
framework such as https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration[Spring Integration] (SI), which is a reference implementation of EIP.

Thankfully SI already provides support for exposing integration flows as functions via
https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/current/reference/html/#java-dsl-gateway[Integration flow as gateway]
Consider the following sample:

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class FunctionSampleSpringIntegrationApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(FunctionSampleSpringIntegrationApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public IntegrationFlow uppercaseFlow() {
		return IntegrationFlows.from(MessageFunction.class, "uppercase")
				.<String, String>transform(String::toUpperCase)
				.logAndReply(LoggingHandler.Level.WARN);
	}

	public interface MessageFunction extends Function<Message<String>, Message<String>> {

	}
}
----

For those who are familiar with SI you can see we define a bean of type `IntegrationFlow` where we
declare an integration flow that we want to expose as a `Function<String, String>` (using SI DSL) called `uppercase`.
The `MessageFunction` interface lets us explicitly declare the type of the inputs and outputs for proper type conversion.
See <<Content Type Negotiation>> section for more on type conversion.

To receive raw input you can use `from(Function.class, ...)`.

The resulting function is bound to the input and output destinations exposed by the target binder.

IMPORTANT: Please refer to <<Binding and Binding names>> section to understand the naming
convention used to establish _binding names_ used by such application.

For more details on interoperability of Spring Integration and Spring Cloud Stream specifically around functional programming model
you may find https://spring.io/blog/2019/10/25/spring-cloud-stream-and-spring-integration[this post] very interesting, as it dives a bit deeper
into various patterns you can apply by merging the best of Spring Integration and Spring Cloud Stream/Functions.

==== Annotation-based support (legacy)
As mentioned earlier you can also use Spring Integration annotations based configuration or
Spring Cloud Stream annotation based configuration.

===== Spring Integration Support

Spring Cloud Stream is built on the concepts and patterns defined by http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/[Enterprise Integration Patterns] and relies
in its internal implementation on an already established and popular implementation of Enterprise Integration Patterns within the Spring portfolio of projects:
https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/[Spring Integration] framework.

So its only natural for it to support the foundation, semantics, and configuration options that are already established by Spring Integration

For example, you can attach the output channel of a `Source` to a `MessageSource` and use the familiar `@InboundChannelAdapter` annotation, as follows:

[source, java]
----
@EnableBinding(Source.class)
public class TimerSource {

  @Bean
  @InboundChannelAdapter(value = Source.OUTPUT, poller = @Poller(fixedDelay = "10", maxMessagesPerPoll = "1"))
  public MessageSource<String> timerMessageSource() {
    return () -> new GenericMessage<>("Hello Spring Cloud Stream");
  }
}
----

Similarly, you can use @Transformer or @ServiceActivator while providing an implementation of a message handler method for a _Processor_ binding contract, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class TransformProcessor {
  @Transformer(inputChannel = Processor.INPUT, outputChannel = Processor.OUTPUT)
  public Object transform(String message) {
    return message.toUpperCase();
  }
}
----

NOTE: While this may be skipping ahead a bit, it is important to understand that, when you consume from the same binding using `@StreamListener` annotation, a pub-sub model is used.
Each method annotated with `@StreamListener` receives its own copy of a message, and each one has its own consumer group.
However, if you consume from the same binding by using one of the Spring Integration annotation (such as `@Aggregator`, `@Transformer`, or `@ServiceActivator`), those consume in a competing model.
No individual consumer group is created for each subscription.

===== Using @StreamListener Annotation

Complementary to its Spring Integration support, Spring Cloud Stream provides its own `@StreamListener` annotation, modeled after other Spring Messaging annotations
(`@MessageMapping`, `@JmsListener`, `@RabbitListener`, and others) and provides conviniences, such as content-based routing and others.

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class VoteHandler {

  @Autowired
  VotingService votingService;

  @StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
  public void handle(Vote vote) {
    votingService.record(vote);
  }
}
----

As with other Spring Messaging methods, method arguments can be annotated with `@Payload`, `@Headers`, and `@Header`.


For methods that return data, you must use the `@SendTo` annotation to specify the output binding destination for data returned by the method, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class TransformProcessor {

  @Autowired
  VotingService votingService;

  @StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
  @SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
  public VoteResult handle(Vote vote) {
    return votingService.record(vote);
  }
}
----


Similar to Spring MVC you can also benefit from JSR-303/309 compliant validation by annotating your arguments with `@Valid`.

[source,java]
----
@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
  @SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
  public VoteResult handle(@Valid Vote vote) {
    return votingService.record(vote);
  }
----
In the above example the `Vote` object and its individual fields will be validated according to the rules set by you (e.g., `@NotBlank`, `@Min`/`@Max` etc.).

NOTE: Spring Cloud Stream does NOT provide a default `org.springframework.validation.Validator` to avoid potential
conflicts with validators provided by other frameworks that may be part of your application (e.g., MVC),
therefore you may need to provide your own validator by configuring a bean of type `org.springframework.validation.Validator`.

===== Using @StreamListener for Content-based routing

Spring Cloud Stream supports dispatching messages to multiple handler methods annotated with `@StreamListener` based on conditions.

In order to be eligible to support conditional dispatching, a method must satisfy the follow conditions:

* It must not return a value.
* It must be an individual message handling method (reactive API methods are not supported).

The condition is specified by a SpEL expression in the `condition` argument of the annotation and is evaluated for each message.
All the handlers that match the condition are invoked in the same thread, and no assumption must be made about the order in which the invocations take place.

In the following example of a `@StreamListener` with dispatching conditions, all the messages bearing a header `type` with the value `bogey` are dispatched to the
`receiveBogey` method, and all the messages bearing a header `type` with the value `bacall` are dispatched to the `receiveBacall` method.

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class TestPojoWithAnnotatedArguments {

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "headers['type']=='bogey'")
    public void receiveBogey(@Payload BogeyPojo bogeyPojo) {
       // handle the message
    }

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "headers['type']=='bacall'")
    public void receiveBacall(@Payload BacallPojo bacallPojo) {
       // handle the message
    }
}
----

*Content Type Negotiation in the Context of `condition`*

It is important to understand some of the mechanics behind content-based routing using the `condition` argument of `@StreamListener`, especially in the context of the type of the message as a whole.
It may also help if you familiarize yourself with the <<Content Type Negotiation>>  before you proceed.

Consider the following scenario:

[source,java]
----
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class CatsAndDogs {

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "payload.class.simpleName=='Dog'")
    public void bark(Dog dog) {
       // handle the message
    }

    @StreamListener(target = Sink.INPUT, condition = "payload.class.simpleName=='Cat'")
    public void purr(Cat cat) {
       // handle the message
    }
}
----

The preceding code is perfectly valid. It compiles and deploys without any issues, yet it never produces the result you expect.

That is because you are testing something that does not yet exist in a state you expect. That is because the payload of the message is not yet converted from the
wire format (`byte[]`) to the desired type.
In other words, it has not yet gone through the type conversion process described in the <<Content Type Negotiation>>.

So, unless you use a SPeL expression that evaluates raw data (for example, the value of the first byte in the byte array), use message header-based expressions
(such as `condition = "headers['type']=='dog'"`).


NOTE: At the moment, dispatching through `@StreamListener` conditions is supported only for channel-based binders (not for reactive programming)
support.



[[spring-cloud-streams-overview-using-polled-consumers]]
==== Using Polled Consumers

===== Overview

When using polled consumers, you poll the `PollableMessageSource` on demand.
Consider the following example of a polled consumer:

[source,java]
----
public interface PolledConsumer {

    @Input
    PollableMessageSource destIn();

    @Output
    MessageChannel destOut();

}
----

Given the polled consumer in the preceding example, you might use it as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource destIn, MessageChannel destOut) {
    return args -> {
        while (someCondition()) {
            try {
                if (!destIn.poll(m -> {
                    String newPayload = ((String) m.getPayload()).toUpperCase();
                    destOut.send(new GenericMessage<>(newPayload));
                })) {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                }
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                // handle failure
            }
        }
    };
}
----

A less manual and more Spring-like alternative would be to configure a scheduled task bean. For example,

[source,java]
----

@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5_000)
public void poll() {
	System.out.println("Polling...");
	this.source.poll(m -> {
		System.out.println(m.getPayload());

	}, new ParameterizedTypeReference<Foo>() { });
}
----


The `PollableMessageSource.poll()` method takes a `MessageHandler` argument (often a lambda expression, as shown here).
It returns `true` if the message was received and successfully processed.

As with message-driven consumers, if the `MessageHandler` throws an exception, messages are published to error channels,
as discussed in `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling>>`.

Normally, the `poll()` method acknowledges the message when the `MessageHandler` exits.
If the method exits abnormally, the message is rejected (not re-queued), but see <<polled-errors>>.
You can override that behavior by taking responsibility for the acknowledgment, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource dest1In, MessageChannel dest2Out) {
    return args -> {
        while (someCondition()) {
            if (!dest1In.poll(m -> {
                StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(m).noAutoAck();
                // e.g. hand off to another thread which can perform the ack
                // or acknowledge(Status.REQUEUE)

            })) {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }
        }
    };
}
----

IMPORTANT: You must `ack` (or `nack`) the message at some point, to avoid resource leaks.

IMPORTANT: Some messaging systems (such as Apache Kafka) maintain a simple offset in a log. If a delivery fails and is re-queued with  `StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(m).acknowledge(Status.REQUEUE);`, any later successfully ack'd messages are redelivered.

There is also an overloaded `poll` method, for which the definition is as follows:

[source,java]
----
poll(MessageHandler handler, ParameterizedTypeReference<?> type)
----

The `type` is a conversion hint that allows the incoming message payload to be converted, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
boolean result = pollableSource.poll(received -> {
			Map<String, Foo> payload = (Map<String, Foo>) received.getPayload();
            ...

		}, new ParameterizedTypeReference<Map<String, Foo>>() {});
----

[[polled-errors]]
===== Handling Errors

By default, an error channel is configured for the pollable source; if the callback throws an exception, an `ErrorMessage` is sent to the error channel (`<destination>.<group>.errors`); this error channel is also bridged to the global Spring Integration `errorChannel`.

You can subscribe to either error channel with a `@ServiceActivator` to handle errors; without a subscription, the error will simply be logged and the message will be acknowledged as successful.
If the error channel service activator throws an exception, the message will be rejected (by default) and won't be redelivered.
If the service activator throws a `RequeueCurrentMessageException`, the message will be requeued at the broker and will be again retrieved on a subsequent poll.

If the listener throws a `RequeueCurrentMessageException` directly, the message will be requeued, as discussed above, and will not be sent to the error channels.

=== Event Routing

Event Routing, in the context of Spring Cloud Stream, is the ability to either
_a) route evens to a particular even subscriber_ or
_b) route event produced by an event subscriber to a particular destination_.
Here we'll refer to it as route ‘TO’ and route ‘FROM’.

==== Routing TO Consumer
Routing can be achieved by relying on `RoutingFunction` available in Spring Cloud Function 3.0. All you need to do is enable it via
`--spring.cloud.stream.function.routing.enabled=true` application property or provide `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` property.
Once enabled `RoutingFunction` will be bound to input destination
receiving all the messages and route them to other functions based on the provided instruction.

IMPORTANT: For the purposes of binding the name of the routing destination is `functionRouter-in-0`
(see RoutingFunction.FUNCTION_NAME and binding naming convention <<Functional binding names>>).

Instruction could be provided with individual messages as well as application properties.

Here are couple of samples:

===== Using message headers
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SampleApplication.class,
                       "--spring.cloud.stream.function.routing.enabled=true");
	}

	@Bean
	public Consumer<String> even() {
		return value -> {
			System.out.println("EVEN: " + value);
		};
	}

	@Bean
	public Consumer<String> odd() {
		return value -> {
			System.out.println("ODD: " + value);
		};
    }
}
----
By sending message to the `functionRouter-in-0` destination exposed by the binder (i.e., rabbit, kafka),
such message will be routed to the appropriate (‘even’ or ‘odd’) Consumer.

By default `RoutingFunction` will look for `spring.cloud.function.definition` or `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` (for more dynamic scenarios with SpEL)
header and if it is found its value will be treated as routing instruction.

For example,
setting `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` header to value `T(java.lang.System).currentTimeMillis() % 2 == 0 ? 'even' : 'odd'` will end up semi-randomly routing request to either `odd` or `even` functions.
Also, for SpEL, the _root object_ of the evaluation context is `Message` so you can do evaluation on individual headers (or message) as well `....routing-expression=headers['type']`

===== Using application properties

The `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression` and/or `spring.cloud.function.definition`
can be passed as application properties (e.g., `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression=headers['type']`.
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class RoutingStreamApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(RoutingStreamApplication.class,
	  "--spring.cloud.function.routing-expression="
	  + "T(java.lang.System).nanoTime() % 2 == 0 ? 'even' : 'odd'");
  }
  @Bean
  public Consumer<Integer> even() {
    return value -> System.out.println("EVEN: " + value);
  }

  @Bean
  public Consumer<Integer> odd() {
    return value -> System.out.println("ODD: " + value);
  }
}
----
IMPORTANT: Passing instructions via application properties is especially important for reactive functions since given that reactive
function is only invoked once to pass the Publisher, so access to the individual items is limited.

==== Routing FROM Consumer

Aside from static destinations, Spring Cloud Stream lets applications send messages to dynamically bound destinations.
This is useful, for example, when the target destination needs to be determined at runtime.
Applications can do so in one of two ways

===== BinderAwareChannelResolver

The `BinderAwareChannelResolver` is a special bean registered automatically by the framework.
You can autowire this bean into your application and use it to resolve output destination at runtime

The 'spring.cloud.stream.dynamicDestinations' property can be used for restricting the dynamic destination names to a known set (whitelisting).
If this property is not set, any destination can be bound dynamically.

The following example demonstrates one of the common scenarios where REST controller uses a path variable to determine target destination:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

    @Autowired
    private BinderAwareChannelResolver resolver;

    @RequestMapping(value="/{target}")
	@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.ACCEPTED)
	public void send(@RequestBody String body, @PathVariable("target") String target){
		resolver.resolveDestination(target).send(new GenericMessage<String>(body));
	}
}
----

Now consider what happens when we start the application on the default port (8080) and make the following requests with CURL:

----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "customer-1" http://localhost:8080/customers

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "order-1" http://localhost:8080/orders
----

The destinations, 'customers' and 'orders', are created in the broker (in the exchange for Rabbit or in the topic for Kafka)
with names of 'customers' and 'orders', and the data is published to the appropriate destinations.

===== spring.cloud.stream.sendto.destination

You can also delegate to the framework to dynamically resolve the output destination by specifying `spring.cloud.stream.sendto.destination` header
set to the name of the destination to be resolved.

Consider the following example:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@Controller
public class SourceWithDynamicDestination {

    @Bean
	public Function<String, Message<String>> destinationAsPayload() {
		return value -> {
			return MessageBuilder.withPayload(value)
				.setHeader("spring.cloud.stream.sendto.destination", value).build();};
	}
}
----

Albeit trivial you can clearly see in this example, our output is a Message with `spring.cloud.stream.sendto.destination` header
set to the value of he input argument. The framework will consult this header and will attempt to create or discover
destination with that name and send output to it.


If destination names are known in advance, you can configure the producer properties as with any other destination.
Alternatively, if you register a `NewDestinationBindingCallback<>` bean, it is invoked just before the binding is created.
The callback takes the generic type of the extended producer properties used by the binder.
It has one method:

[source, java]
----
void configure(String destinationName, MessageChannel channel, ProducerProperties producerProperties,
        T extendedProducerProperties);
----

The following example shows how to use the RabbitMQ binder:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public NewDestinationBindingCallback<RabbitProducerProperties> dynamicConfigurer() {
    return (name, channel, props, extended) -> {
        props.setRequiredGroups("bindThisQueue");
        extended.setQueueNameGroupOnly(true);
        extended.setAutoBindDlq(true);
        extended.setDeadLetterQueueName("myDLQ");
    };
}
----

NOTE: If you need to support dynamic destinations with multiple binder types, use `Object` for the generic type and cast the `extended` argument as needed.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling]]
=== Error Handling

In this section we'll explain the general idea behind error handling mechanisms provided by the framework.
We'll be using Rabbit binder as an example, since individual binders define different set
of properties for certain supported mechanisms specific to underlying broker capabilities (such as Kafka binder).

Errors happen, and Spring Cloud Stream provides several flexible mechanisms to deal with them. Note that the techniques are dependent on binder implementation and the
capability of the underlying messaging middleware.

Whenever there is an exception during message processing, the framework will make several attempts at re-trying
the same message (3 by default). For that, the framework uses https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] library
(for imperative functions and standard message handlers) and `retryBackoff` capabilities of the reactive API (for reactive
functions).

Whenever handler (function) throws and exception, it is propagated back to the binder, and the binder subsequently propagates
the error back to the messaging system.
Depending on the capabilities of the messaging system such system may _drop_ the message, _re-queue_ the message for re-processing or _send the failed message to DLQ_.
Both Rabbit and Kafka support these concepts. However, other binders may not, so refer to your individual binder’s documentation for details on supported
error-handling options.

==== Drop Failed Messages

By default, if no additional system-level configuration is provided, the messaging system drops the failed message.
While acceptable in some cases, for most cases, it is not, and we need some recovery mechanism to avoid message loss.

==== DLQ - Dead Letter Queue

Perhaps the most common mechanism, DLQ allows failed messages to be sent to a special destination: - _Dead Letter Queue_.

When configured, failed messages are sent to this destination for subsequent re-processing or auditing and reconciliation.

Consider the following example:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SimpleStreamApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		SpringApplication.run(SimpleStreamApplication.class,
		  "--spring.cloud.function.definition=uppercase",
		  "--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.destination=uppercase",
		  "--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.group=myGroup",
		  "--spring.cloud.stream.rabbit.bindings.uppercase-in-0.consumer.auto-bind-dlq=true"
		);
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<Person, Person> uppercase() {
		return personIn -> {
		   throw new RuntimeException("intentional");
	      });
		};
	}
}
----

As a reminder, in this example `uppercase-in-0` segment of the property corresponds to the name of the input destination binding.
The `consumer` segment indicates that it is a consumer property.

NOTE: When using DLQ, at least `group` property must be provided for proper naming of the DLQ destination. However `group` often used together
with `destination` property, as in our example.


Aside from some standard properties we also set the `auto-bind-dlq` to instruct the binder to create and configure DLQ destination for
`uppercase-in-0` binding which corresponds to `uppercase` destination (see corresponding property), which results in an additional Rabbit queue named `uppercase.myGroup.dlq` (see Kafka documentation for Kafka specific DLQ properties).

Once configured, all failed messages are routed to this destination preserving the original message for further actions.

And you can see that the error message contains more information relevant to the original error, as follows:

[source,text]
----
. . . .
x-exception-stacktrace:	org.springframework.messaging.MessageHandlingException: nested exception is
      org.springframework.messaging.MessagingException: has an error, failedMessage=GenericMessage [payload=byte[15],
      headers={amqp_receivedDeliveryMode=NON_PERSISTENT, amqp_receivedRoutingKey=input.hello, amqp_deliveryTag=1,
      deliveryAttempt=3, amqp_consumerQueue=input.hello, amqp_redelivered=false, id=a15231e6-3f80-677b-5ad7-d4b1e61e486e,

      at org.spring...integ...han...MethodInvokingMessageProcessor.processMessage(MethodInvokingMessageProcessor.java:107)
      at. . . . .
Payload: blah
----

You can also facilitate immediate dispatch to DLQ (without re-tries) by setting `max-attempts` to '1'. For example,
[source,text]
----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.consumer.max-attempts=1
----

==== Retry Template and retryBackoff

In this section we cover configuration properties relevant to configuration of retry capabilities.
Given that we use two different mechanisms for imperative and reactive handlers (RetryTemplate and retryBackoff), properties that corresponds to both will be identified as such.

The `RetryTemplate` is part of the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] library.
While it is out of scope of this document to cover all of the capabilities of the `RetryTemplate`, we will mention the following consumer properties that are specifically related to
the `RetryTemplate`:

maxAttempts::
The number of attempts to process the message.
+
Default: 3. - Applies to 'retryBackoff'
backOffInitialInterval::
The backoff initial interval on retry.
+
Default 1000 milliseconds. -  Applies to 'retryBackoff'
backOffMaxInterval::
The maximum backoff interval.
+
Default 10000 milliseconds. - Applies to 'retryBackoff'
backOffMultiplier::
The backoff multiplier.
+
Default 2.0.
defaultRetryable::
Whether exceptions thrown by the listener that are not listed in the `retryableExceptions` are retryable.
+
Default: `true`.
retryableExceptions::
A map of Throwable class names in the key and a boolean in the value.
Specify those exceptions (and subclasses) that will or won't be retried.
Also see `defaultRetriable`.
Example: `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.retryable-exceptions.java.lang.IllegalStateException=false`.
+
Default: empty.

While the preceding settings are sufficient for majority of the customization requirements, they may not satisfy certain complex requirements at, which
point you may want to provide your own instance of the `RetryTemplate`. To do so configure it as a bean in your application configuration. The application provided
instance will override the one provided by the framework. Also, to avoid conflicts you must qualify the instance of the `RetryTemplate` you want to be used by the binder
as `@StreamRetryTemplate`. For example,

[source,java]
----
@StreamRetryTemplate
public RetryTemplate myRetryTemplate() {
    return new RetryTemplate();
}
----
As you can see from the above example you don't need to annotate it with `@Bean` since `@StreamRetryTemplate` is a qualified `@Bean`.

If you need to be more precise with your `RetryTemplate`, you can specify the bean by name in your `ConsumerProperties` to associate
the specific retry bean per binding.

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<foo>.consumer.retry-template-name=<your-retry-template-bean-name>
----


[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-binders]]
== Binders

Spring Cloud Stream provides a Binder abstraction for use in connecting to physical destinations at the external middleware.
This section provides information about the main concepts behind the Binder SPI, its main components, and implementation-specific details.

=== Producers and Consumers

The following image shows the general relationship of producers and consumers:

.Producers and Consumers
image::{github-raw}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/producers-consumers.png[width=800,scaledwidth="75%",align="center"]

A producer is any component that sends messages to a binding destination.
The binding destination can be bound to an external message broker with a `Binder` implementation for that broker.
When invoking the `bindProducer()` method, the first parameter is the name of the destination within the broker, the second parameter is the instance if local destination to which the producer sends messages, and the third parameter contains properties (such as a partition key expression) to be used within the adapter that is created for that binding destination.

A consumer is any component that receives messages from the binding destination.
As with a producer, the consumer can be bound to an external message broker.
When invoking the `bindConsumer()` method, the first parameter is the destination name, and a second parameter provides the name of a logical group of consumers.
Each group that is represented by consumer bindings for a given destination receives a copy of each message that a producer sends to that destination (that is, it follows normal publish-subscribe semantics).
If there are multiple consumer instances bound with the same group name, then messages are load-balanced across those consumer instances so that each message sent by a producer is consumed by only a single consumer instance within each group (that is, it follows normal queueing semantics).

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-binder-api]]
=== Binder SPI

The Binder SPI consists of a number of interfaces, out-of-the box utility classes, and discovery strategies that provide a pluggable mechanism for connecting to external middleware.

The key point of the SPI is the `Binder` interface, which is a strategy for connecting inputs and outputs to external middleware. The following listing shows the definition of the `Binder` interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface Binder<T, C extends ConsumerProperties, P extends ProducerProperties> {
    Binding<T> bindConsumer(String bindingName, String group, T inboundBindTarget, C consumerProperties);

    Binding<T> bindProducer(String bindingName, T outboundBindTarget, P producerProperties);
}
----

The interface is parameterized, offering a number of extension points:

* Input and output bind targets.
* Extended consumer and producer properties, allowing specific Binder implementations to add supplemental properties that can be supported in a type-safe manner.

A typical binder implementation consists of the following:

* A class that implements the `Binder` interface;
* A Spring `@Configuration` class that creates a bean of type `Binder` along with the middleware connection infrastructure.
* A `META-INF/spring.binders` file found on the classpath containing one or more binder definitions, as shown in the following example:
+
[source]
----
kafka:\
org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.config.KafkaBinderConfiguration
----

NOTE: As it was mentioned earlier Binder abstraction is also one of the extension points of the framework. So if you can't find a suitable binder in the preceding list you can implement your own binder on top of Spring Cloud Stream.
The https://medium.com/@domenicosibilio/how-to-create-a-spring-cloud-stream-binder-from-scratch-ab8b29ee931b[How to create a Spring Cloud Stream Binder from scratch] post a community member documents
in details with example a set of steps necessary to implement custom binder.


=== Binder Detection

Spring Cloud Stream relies on implementations of the Binder SPI to perform the task of connecting (binding) user code to message brokers.
Each Binder implementation typically connects to one type of messaging system.

==== Classpath Detection

By default, Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot's auto-configuration to configure the binding process.
If a single Binder implementation is found on the classpath, Spring Cloud Stream automatically uses it.
For example, a Spring Cloud Stream project that aims to bind only to RabbitMQ can add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

For the specific Maven coordinates of other binder dependencies, see the documentation of that binder implementation.

[[multiple-binders]]
=== Multiple Binders on the Classpath

When multiple binders are present on the classpath, the application must indicate which binder is to be used for each destination binding.
Each binder configuration contains a `META-INF/spring.binders` file, which is a simple properties file, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
rabbit:\
org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.rabbit.config.RabbitServiceAutoConfiguration
----

Similar files exist for the other provided binder implementations (such as Kafka), and custom binder implementations are expected to provide them as well.
The key represents an identifying name for the binder implementation, whereas the value is a comma-separated list of configuration classes that each contain one and only one bean definition of type `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.Binder`.

Binder selection can either be performed globally, using the `spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder` property (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder=rabbit`) or individually, by configuring the binder on each binding.
For instance, a processor application (that has bindings named `input` and `output` for read and write respectively) that reads from Kafka and writes to RabbitMQ can specify the following configuration:

[source]
----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.binder=kafka
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.binder=rabbit
----

[[multiple-systems]]
=== Connecting to Multiple Systems

By default, binders share the application's Spring Boot auto-configuration, so that one instance of each binder found on the classpath is created.
If your application should connect to more than one broker of the same type, you can specify multiple binder configurations, each with different environment settings.

NOTE: Turning on explicit binder configuration disables the default binder configuration process altogether.
If you do so, all binders in use must be included in the configuration.
Frameworks that intend to use Spring Cloud Stream transparently may create binder configurations that can be referenced by name, but they do not affect the default binder configuration.
In order to do so, a binder configuration may have its `defaultCandidate` flag set to false (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.binders.<configurationName>.defaultCandidate=false`).
This denotes a configuration that exists independently of the default binder configuration process.

The following example shows a typical configuration for a processor application that connects to two RabbitMQ broker instances:

[source,yml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      bindings:
        input:
          destination: thing1
          binder: rabbit1
        output:
          destination: thing2
          binder: rabbit2
      binders:
        rabbit1:
          type: rabbit
          environment:
            spring:
              rabbitmq:
                host: <host1>
        rabbit2:
          type: rabbit
          environment:
            spring:
              rabbitmq:
                host: <host2>
----
NOTE: The `environment` property of the particular binder can also be used for any Spring Boot property,
including this `spring.main.sources` which can be useful for adding additional configurations for the
particular binders, e.g. overriding auto-configured beans.

For example;
[source, yaml]
----
environment:
    spring:
        main:
           sources: com.acme.config.MyCustomBinderConfiguration
----

To activate a specific profile for the particular binder environment, you should use a `spring.profiles.active` property:

[source, yaml]
----
environment:
    spring:
        profiles:
           active: myBinderProfile
----
[[binding_visualization_control]]
=== Binding visualization and control
Since version 2.0, Spring Cloud Stream supports visualization and control of the Bindings through Actuator endpoints.

Starting with version 2.0 actuator and web are optional, you must first add one of the web dependencies as well as add the actuator dependency manually.
The following example shows how to add the dependency for the Web framework:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The following example shows how to add the dependency for the WebFlux framework:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

You can add the Actuator dependency as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: To run Spring Cloud Stream 2.0 apps in Cloud Foundry, you must add `spring-boot-starter-web` and `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to the classpath. Otherwise, the
application will not start due to health check failures.

You must also enable the `bindings` actuator endpoints by setting the following property: `--management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=bindings`.

Once those prerequisites are satisfied. you should see the following in the logs when application start:

	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[POST]. . .
	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings],methods=[GET]. . .
	: Mapped "{[/actuator/bindings/{name}],methods=[GET]. . .

To visualize the current bindings, access the following URL:
`http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings`

Alternative, to see a single binding, access one of the URLs similar to the following:
`http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/<bindingName>`

You can also stop, start, pause, and resume individual bindings by posting to the same URL while providing a `state` argument as JSON, as shown in the following examples:

    curl -d '{"state":"STOPPED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"STARTED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"PAUSED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName
    curl -d '{"state":"RESUMED"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://<host>:<port>/actuator/bindings/myBindingName

NOTE: `PAUSED` and `RESUMED` work only when the corresponding binder and its underlying technology supports it. Otherwise, you see the warning message in the logs.
Currently, only Kafka binder supports the `PAUSED` and `RESUMED` states.

=== Binder Configuration Properties

The following properties are available when customizing binder configurations. These properties exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.config.BinderProperties`

They must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.binders.<configurationName>`.

type::
The binder type.
It typically references one of the binders found on the classpath -- in particular, a key in a `META-INF/spring.binders` file.
+
By default, it has the same value as the configuration name.
inheritEnvironment::
Whether the configuration inherits the environment of the application itself.
+
Default: `true`.
environment::
Root for a set of properties that can be used to customize the environment of the binder.
When this property is set, the context in which the binder is being created is not a child of the application context.
This setting allows for complete separation between the binder components and the application components.
+
Default: `empty`.
defaultCandidate::
Whether the binder configuration is a candidate for being considered a default binder or can be used only when explicitly referenced.
This setting allows adding binder configurations without interfering with the default processing.
+
Default: `true`.

== Configuration Options

Spring Cloud Stream supports general configuration options as well as configuration for bindings and binders.
Some binders let additional binding properties support middleware-specific features.

Configuration options can be provided to Spring Cloud Stream applications through any mechanism supported by Spring Boot.
This includes application arguments, environment variables, and YAML or .properties files.

=== Binding Service Properties

These properties are exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.config.BindingServiceProperties`

spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount::
The number of deployed instances of an application.
Must be set for partitioning on the producer side. Must be set on the consumer side when using RabbitMQ and with Kafka if `autoRebalanceEnabled=false`.
+
Default: `1`.

spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex::
The instance index of the application: A number from `0` to `instanceCount - 1`.
Used for partitioning with RabbitMQ and with Kafka if `autoRebalanceEnabled=false`.
Automatically set in Cloud Foundry to match the application's instance index.

spring.cloud.stream.dynamicDestinations::
A list of destinations that can be bound dynamically (for example, in a dynamic routing scenario).
If set, only listed destinations can be bound.
+
Default: empty (letting any destination be bound).

spring.cloud.stream.defaultBinder::
The default binder to use, if multiple binders are configured.
See <<multiple-binders,Multiple Binders on the Classpath>>.
+
Default: empty.

spring.cloud.stream.overrideCloudConnectors::
This property is only applicable when the `cloud` profile is active and Spring Cloud Connectors are provided with the application.
If the property is `false` (the default), the binder detects a suitable bound service (for example, a RabbitMQ service bound in Cloud Foundry for the RabbitMQ binder) and uses it for creating connections (usually through Spring Cloud Connectors).
When set to `true`, this property instructs binders to completely ignore the bound services and rely on Spring Boot properties (for example, relying on the `spring.rabbitmq.*` properties provided in the environment for the RabbitMQ binder).
The typical usage of this property is to be nested in a customized environment <<multiple-systems, when connecting to multiple systems>>.
+
Default: `false`.

spring.cloud.stream.bindingRetryInterval::
The interval (in seconds) between retrying binding creation when, for example, the binder does not support late binding and the broker (for example, Apache Kafka) is down.
Set it to zero to treat such conditions as fatal, preventing the application from starting.
+
Default: `30`

[[binding-properties]]
=== Binding Properties

Binding properties are supplied by using the format of `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<bindingName>.<property>=<value>`.
The `<bindingName>` represents the name of the binding being configured.

For example, for the following function
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	return v -> v.toUpperCase();
}
----
there are two bindings named `uppercase-in-0` for input and `uppercase-out-0` for output. See <<Binding and Binding names>> for more details.

To avoid repetition, Spring Cloud Stream supports setting values for all bindings, in the format of `spring.cloud.stream.default.<property>=<value>`
and `spring.cloud.stream.default.<producer|consumer>.<property>=<value>` for common binding properties.

When it comes to avoiding repetitions for extended binding properties, this format should be used - `spring.cloud.stream.<binder-type>.default.<producer|consumer>.<property>=<value>`.

==== Common Binding Properties

These properties are exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.config.BindingProperties`

The following binding properties are available for both input and output bindings and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<bindingName>.`
(for example, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.destination=ticktock`).

Default values can be set by using the `spring.cloud.stream.default` prefix (for example`spring.cloud.stream.default.contentType=application/json`).

destination::
The target destination of a binding on the bound middleware (for example, the RabbitMQ exchange or Kafka topic).
If binding represents a consumer binding (input), it could be bound to multiple destinations, and the destination names can be specified as comma-separated `String` values.
If not, he actual binding name is used instead.
The default value of this property cannot be overridden.
group::
The consumer group of the binding.
Applies only to inbound bindings.
See <<consumer-groups,Consumer Groups>>.
+
Default: `null` (indicating an anonymous consumer).
contentType::
The content type of this binding.
See `<<content-type-management>>`.
+
Default: `application/json`.
binder::
The binder used by this binding.
See `<<multiple-binders>>` for details.
+
Default: `null` (the default binder is used, if it exists).

==== Consumer Properties

These properties are exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.ConsumerProperties`

The following binding properties are available for input bindings only and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<bindingName>.consumer.` (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.concurrency=3`).

Default values can be set by using the `spring.cloud.stream.default.consumer` prefix (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.default.consumer.headerMode=none`).

autoStartup::
Signals if this consumer needs to be started automatically
+
Default: `true`.
concurrency::
The concurrency of the inbound consumer.
+
Default: `1`.
partitioned::
Whether the consumer receives data from a partitioned producer.
+
Default: `false`.
headerMode::
When set to `none`, disables header parsing on input.
Effective only for messaging middleware that does not support message headers natively and requires header embedding.
This option is useful when consuming data from non-Spring Cloud Stream applications when native headers are not supported.
When set to `headers`, it uses the middleware's native header mechanism.
When set to `embeddedHeaders`, it embeds headers into the message payload.
+
Default: depends on the binder implementation.
maxAttempts::
If processing fails, the number of attempts to process the message (including the first).
Set to `1` to disable retry.
+
Default: `3`.
backOffInitialInterval::
The backoff initial interval on retry.
+
Default: `1000`.
backOffMaxInterval::
The maximum backoff interval.
+
Default: `10000`.
backOffMultiplier::
The backoff multiplier.
+
Default: `2.0`.
defaultRetryable::
Whether exceptions thrown by the listener that are not listed in the `retryableExceptions` are retryable.
+
Default: `true`.
instanceCount::
When set to a value greater than equal to zero, it allows customizing the instance count of this consumer (if different from `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount`).
When set to a negative value, it defaults to `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount`.
See `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count>>` for more information.
+
Default: `-1`.
instanceIndex::
When set to a value greater than equal to zero, it allows customizing the instance index of this consumer (if different from `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex`).
When set to a negative value, it defaults to `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex`.
Ignored if `instanceIndexList` is provided.
See `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count>>` for more information.
+
Default: `-1`.
instanceIndexList::
Used with binders that do not support native partitioning (such as RabbitMQ); allows an application instance to consume from more than one partition.
+
Default: empty.
retryableExceptions::
A map of Throwable class names in the key and a boolean in the value.
Specify those exceptions (and subclasses) that will or won't be retried.
Also see `defaultRetriable`.
Example: `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.consumer.retryable-exceptions.java.lang.IllegalStateException=false`.
+
Default: empty.
useNativeDecoding::
When set to `true`, the inbound message is deserialized directly by the client library, which must be configured correspondingly (for example, setting an appropriate Kafka producer value deserializer).
When this configuration is being used, the inbound message unmarshalling is not based on the `contentType` of the binding.
When native decoding is used, it is the responsibility of the producer to use an appropriate encoder (for example, the Kafka producer value serializer) to serialize the outbound message.
Also, when native encoding and decoding is used, the `headerMode=embeddedHeaders` property is ignored and headers are not embedded in the message.
See the producer property `useNativeEncoding`.
+
Default: `false`.
multiplex::
When set to true, the underlying binder will natively multiplex destinations on the same input binding.
+
Default: `false`.

==== Advanced Consumer Configuration

For advanced configuration of the underlying message listener container for message-driven consumers, add a single `ListenerContainerCustomizer` bean to the application context.
It will be invoked after the above properties have been applied and can be used to set additional properties.
Similarly, for polled consumers, add a `MessageSourceCustomizer` bean.

The following is an example for the RabbitMQ binder:

====
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ListenerContainerCustomizer<AbstractMessageListenerContainer> containerCustomizer() {
    return (container, dest, group) -> container.setAdviceChain(advice1, advice2);
}

@Bean
public MessageSourceCustomizer<AmqpMessageSource> sourceCustomizer() {
    return (source, dest, group) -> source.setPropertiesConverter(customPropertiesConverter);
}
----
====

==== Producer Properties

These properties are exposed via `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.ProducerProperties`

The following binding properties are available for output bindings only and must be prefixed with `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<bindingName>.producer.` (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id`).

Default values can be set by using the prefix `spring.cloud.stream.default.producer` (for example, `spring.cloud.stream.default.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id`).

autoStartup::
Signals if this consumer needs to be started automatically
+
Default: `true`.
partitionKeyExpression::
A SpEL expression that determines how to partition outbound data.
If set, outbound data on this binding is partitioned. `partitionCount` must be set to a value greater than 1 to be effective.
See `<<partitioning>>`.
+
Default: null.

partitionKeyExtractorName::
The name of the bean that implements `PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy`. Used to extract a key used to compute
the partition id (see 'partitionSelector*'). Mutually exclusive with 'partitionKeyExpression'.
+
Default: null.

partitionSelectorName::
The name of the bean that implements `PartitionSelectorStrategy`. Used to determine partition id based
on partition key (see 'partitionKeyExtractor*'). Mutually exclusive with 'partitionSelectorExpression'.
+
Default: null.


partitionSelectorExpression::
A SpEL expression for customizing partition selection.
If neither is set, the partition is selected as the `hashCode(key) % partitionCount`, where `key` is computed through either `partitionKeyExpression`.
+
Default: `null`.
partitionCount::
The number of target partitions for the data, if partitioning is enabled.
Must be set to a value greater than 1 if the producer is partitioned.
On Kafka, it is interpreted as a hint. The larger of this and the partition count of the target topic is used instead.
+
Default: `1`.
requiredGroups::
A comma-separated list of groups to which the producer must ensure message delivery even if they start after it has been created (for example, by pre-creating durable queues in RabbitMQ).
headerMode::
When set to `none`, it disables header embedding on output.
It is effective only for messaging middleware that does not support message headers natively and requires header embedding.
This option is useful when producing data for non-Spring Cloud Stream applications when native headers are not supported.
When set to `headers`, it uses the middleware's native header mechanism.
When set to `embeddedHeaders`, it embeds headers into the message payload.
+
Default: Depends on the binder implementation.
useNativeEncoding::
When set to `true`, the outbound message is serialized directly by the client library, which must be configured correspondingly (for example, setting an appropriate Kafka producer value serializer).
When this configuration is being used, the outbound message marshalling is not based on the `contentType` of the binding.
When native encoding is used, it is the responsibility of the consumer to use an appropriate decoder (for example, the Kafka consumer value de-serializer) to deserialize the inbound message.
Also, when native encoding and decoding is used, the `headerMode=embeddedHeaders` property is ignored and headers are not embedded in the message.
See the consumer property `useNativeDecoding`.
+
Default: `false`.


[[content-type-management]]
== Content Type Negotiation

Data transformation is one of the core features of any message-driven microservice architecture. Given that, in Spring Cloud Stream, such data
is represented as a Spring `Message`, a message may have to be transformed to a desired shape or size before reaching its destination. This is required for two reasons:

. To convert the contents of the incoming message to match the signature of the application-provided handler.

. To convert the contents of the outgoing message to the wire format.

The wire format is typically `byte[]` (that is true for the Kafka and Rabbit binders), but it is governed by the binder implementation.

In Spring Cloud Stream, message transformation is accomplished with an `org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter`.

NOTE: As a supplement to the details to follow, you may also want to read the following https://spring.io/blog/2018/02/26/spring-cloud-stream-2-0-content-type-negotiation-and-transformation[blog post].

=== Mechanics

To better understand the mechanics and the necessity behind content-type negotiation, we take a look at a very simple use case by using the following message handler as an example:

[source, java]
----

public Function<Person, Person> personFunction {..}
----

NOTE: For simplicity, we assume that this is the only handler function in the application (we assume there is no internal pipeline).

The handler shown in the preceding example expects a `Person` object as an argument and produces a `String` type as an output.
In order for the framework to succeed in passing the incoming `Message` as an argument to this handler, it has to somehow transform the payload of the `Message` type from the wire format to a `Person` type.
In other words, the framework must locate and apply the appropriate `MessageConverter`.
To accomplish that, the framework needs some instructions from the user.
One of these instructions is already provided by the signature of the handler method itself (`Person` type).
Consequently, in theory, that should be (and, in some cases, is) enough.
However, for the majority of use cases, in order to select the appropriate `MessageConverter`, the framework needs an additional piece of information.
That missing piece is `contentType`.

Spring Cloud Stream provides three mechanisms to define `contentType` (in order of precedence):

. *HEADER*: The `contentType` can be communicated through the Message itself. By providing a `contentType` header, you declare the content type to use to locate and apply the appropriate `MessageConverter`.

. *BINDING*: The `contentType` can be set per destination binding by setting the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.content-type` property.
+
NOTE: The `input` segment in the property name corresponds to the actual name of the destination (which is “input” in our case). This approach lets you declare, on a per-binding basis, the content type to use to locate and apply the appropriate `MessageConverter`.

. *DEFAULT*: If `contentType` is not present in the `Message` header or the binding, the default `application/json` content type is used to
locate and apply the appropriate `MessageConverter`.

As mentioned earlier, the preceding list also demonstrates the order of precedence in case of a tie. For example, a header-provided content type takes precedence over any other content type.
The same applies for a content type set on a per-binding basis, which essentially lets you override the default content type.
However, it also provides a sensible default (which was determined from community feedback).

Another reason for making `application/json` the default stems from the interoperability requirements driven by distributed microservices architectures, where producer and consumer not only run in different JVMs but can also run on different non-JVM platforms.

When the non-void handler method returns, if the return value is already a `Message`, that `Message` becomes the payload. However, when the return value is not a `Message`, the new `Message` is constructed with the return value as the payload while inheriting
headers from the input `Message` minus the headers defined or filtered by `SpringIntegrationProperties.messageHandlerNotPropagatedHeaders`.
By default, there is only one header set there: `contentType`. This means that the new `Message` does not have `contentType` header set, thus ensuring that the `contentType` can evolve.
You can always opt out of returning a `Message` from the handler method where you can inject any header you wish.

If there is an internal pipeline, the `Message` is sent to the next handler by going through the same process of conversion. However, if there is no internal pipeline or you have reached the end of it, the `Message` is sent back to the output destination.

==== Content Type versus Argument Type

As mentioned earlier, for the framework to select the appropriate `MessageConverter`, it requires argument type and, optionally, content type information.
The logic for selecting the appropriate `MessageConverter` resides with the argument resolvers (`HandlerMethodArgumentResolvers`), which trigger right before the invocation of the user-defined handler method (which is when the actual argument type is known to the framework).
If the argument type does not match the type of the current payload, the framework delegates to the stack of the
pre-configured `MessageConverters` to see if any one of them can convert the payload.
As you can see, the  `Object fromMessage(Message<?> message, Class<?> targetClass);`
operation of the MessageConverter takes `targetClass` as one of its arguments.
The framework also ensures that the provided `Message` always contains a `contentType` header.
When no contentType header was already present, it injects either the per-binding `contentType` header or the default `contentType` header.
The combination of `contentType` argument type is the mechanism by which framework determines if message can be converted to a target type.
If no appropriate `MessageConverter` is found, an exception is thrown, which you can handle by adding a custom `MessageConverter` (see `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-user-defined-message-converters>>`).

But what if the payload type matches the target type declared by the handler method? In this case, there is nothing to convert, and the
payload is passed unmodified. While this sounds pretty straightforward and logical, keep in mind handler methods that take a `Message<?>` or `Object` as an argument.
By declaring the target type to be `Object` (which is an `instanceof` everything in Java), you essentially forfeit the conversion process.

NOTE: Do not expect `Message` to be converted into some other type based only on the `contentType`.
Remember that the `contentType` is complementary to the target type.
If you wish, you can provide a hint, which `MessageConverter` may or may not take into consideration.

==== Message Converters

`MessageConverters` define two methods:

[source, java]
----
Object fromMessage(Message<?> message, Class<?> targetClass);

Message<?> toMessage(Object payload, @Nullable MessageHeaders headers);
----

It is important to understand the contract of these methods and their usage, specifically in the context of Spring Cloud Stream.

The `fromMessage` method converts an incoming `Message` to an argument type.
The payload of the `Message` could be any type, and it is
up to the actual implementation of the `MessageConverter` to support multiple types.
For example, some JSON converter may support the payload type as `byte[]`, `String`, and others.
This is important when the application contains an internal pipeline (that is, input -> handler1 -> handler2 ->. . . -> output) and the output of the upstream handler results in a `Message` which may not be in the initial wire format.

However, the `toMessage` method has a more strict contract and must always convert `Message` to the wire format: `byte[]`.

So, for all intents and purposes (and especially when implementing your own converter) you regard the two methods as having the following signatures:

[source, java]
----
Object fromMessage(Message<?> message, Class<?> targetClass);

Message<byte[]> toMessage(Object payload, @Nullable MessageHeaders headers);
----

=== Provided MessageConverters

As mentioned earlier, the framework already provides a stack of `MessageConverters` to handle most common use cases.
The following list describes the provided `MessageConverters`, in order of precedence (the first `MessageConverter` that works is used):

. `ApplicationJsonMessageMarshallingConverter`: Variation of the `org.springframework.messaging.converter.MappingJackson2MessageConverter`. Supports conversion of the payload of the `Message` to/from POJO for cases when `contentType` is `application/json` (DEFAULT).
. `ByteArrayMessageConverter`: Supports conversion of the payload of the `Message` from `byte[]` to `byte[]` for cases when `contentType` is `application/octet-stream`. It is essentially a pass through and exists primarily for backward compatibility.
. `ObjectStringMessageConverter`: Supports conversion of any type to a `String` when `contentType` is `text/plain`.
It invokes Object’s `toString()` method or, if the payload is `byte[]`, a new `String(byte[])`.
. `JsonUnmarshallingConverter`: Similar to the `ApplicationJsonMessageMarshallingConverter`. It supports conversion of any type when `contentType` is `application/x-java-object`.
It expects the actual type information to be embedded in the `contentType` as an attribute (for example, `application/x-java-object;type=foo.bar.Cat`).

When no appropriate converter is found, the framework throws an exception. When that happens, you should check your code and configuration and ensure you did not miss anything (that is, ensure that you provided a `contentType` by using a binding or a header).
However, most likely, you found some uncommon case (such as a custom `contentType` perhaps) and the current stack of provided `MessageConverters`
does not know how to convert. If that is the case, you can add custom `MessageConverter`. See <<spring-cloud-stream-overview-user-defined-message-converters>>.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-user-defined-message-converters]]
=== User-defined Message Converters

Spring Cloud Stream exposes a mechanism to define and register additional `MessageConverters`.
To use it, implement `org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConverter`, configure it as a `@Bean`.
It is then appended to the existing stack of `MessageConverter`s.

NOTE: It is important to understand that custom `MessageConverter` implementations are added to the head of the existing stack.
Consequently, custom `MessageConverter` implementations take precedence over the existing ones, which lets you override as well as add to the existing converters.

The following example shows how to create a message converter bean to support a new content type called `application/bar`:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public static class SinkApplication {

    ...

    @Bean
    public MessageConverter customMessageConverter() {
        return new MyCustomMessageConverter();
    }
}

public class MyCustomMessageConverter extends AbstractMessageConverter {

    public MyCustomMessageConverter() {
        super(new MimeType("application", "bar"));
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean supports(Class<?> clazz) {
        return (Bar.class.equals(clazz));
    }

    @Override
    protected Object convertFromInternal(Message<?> message, Class<?> targetClass, Object conversionHint) {
        Object payload = message.getPayload();
        return (payload instanceof Bar ? payload : new Bar((byte[]) payload));
    }
}
----

Spring Cloud Stream also provides support for Avro-based converters and schema evolution.
See `<<schema-evolution>>` for details.

== Inter-Application Communication

Spring Cloud Stream enables communication between applications. Inter-application communication is a complex issue spanning several concerns, as described in the following topics:

* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-connecting-multiple-application-instances>>`
* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count>>`
* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-partitioning>>`

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-connecting-multiple-application-instances]]
=== Connecting Multiple Application Instances

While Spring Cloud Stream makes it easy for individual Spring Boot applications to connect to messaging systems, the typical scenario for Spring Cloud Stream is the creation of multi-application pipelines, where microservice applications send data to each other.
You can achieve this scenario by correlating the input and output destinations of "`adjacent`" applications.

Suppose a design calls for the Time Source application to send data to the Log Sink application. You could use a common destination named `ticktock` for bindings within both applications.

Time Source (that has the binding named `output`) would set the following property:

----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=ticktock
----

Log Sink (that has the binding named `input`) would set the following property:

----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=ticktock
----

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-instance-index-instance-count]]
=== Instance Index and Instance Count

When scaling up Spring Cloud Stream applications, each instance can receive information about how many other instances of the same application exist and what its own instance index is.
Spring Cloud Stream does this through the `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` properties.
For example, if there are three instances of a HDFS sink application, all three instances have `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` set to `3`, and the individual applications have `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` set to `0`, `1`, and `2`, respectively.

When Spring Cloud Stream applications are deployed through Spring Cloud Data Flow, these properties are configured automatically; when Spring Cloud Stream applications are launched independently, these properties must be set correctly.
By default, `spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount` is `1`, and `spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex` is `0`.

In a scaled-up scenario, correct configuration of these two properties is important for addressing partitioning behavior (see below) in general, and the two properties are always required by certain binders (for example, the Kafka binder) in order to ensure that data are split correctly across multiple consumer instances.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-partitioning]]
=== Partitioning

Partitioning in Spring Cloud Stream consists of two tasks:

* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-output-bindings-partitioning>>`
* `<<spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-input-bindings-partitioning>>`

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-output-bindings-partitioning]]
==== Configuring Output Bindings for Partitioning

You can configure an output binding to send partitioned data by setting one and only one of its `partitionKeyExpression` or `partitionKeyExtractorName` properties, as well as its `partitionCount` property.

For example, the following is a valid and typical configuration:

----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExpression=payload.id
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5
----

Based on that example configuration, data is sent to the target partition by using the following logic.

A partition key's value is calculated for each message sent to a partitioned output binding based on the `partitionKeyExpression`.
The `partitionKeyExpression` is a SpEL expression that is evaluated against the outbound message for extracting the partitioning key.

If a SpEL expression is not sufficient for your needs, you can instead calculate the partition key value by providing an implementation of `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy` and configuring it as a bean (by using the `@Bean` annotation).
If you have more then one bean of type `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy` available in the Application Context, you can further filter it by specifying its name with the `partitionKeyExtractorName` property, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorName=customPartitionKeyExtractor
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionCount=5
. . .
@Bean
public CustomPartitionKeyExtractorClass customPartitionKeyExtractor() {
    return new CustomPartitionKeyExtractorClass();
}
----

NOTE: In previous versions of Spring Cloud Stream, you could specify the implementation of `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy` by setting the  `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionKeyExtractorClass` property.
Since version 3.0, this property is removed.

Once the message key is calculated, the partition selection process determines the target partition as a value between `0` and `partitionCount - 1`.
The default calculation, applicable in most scenarios, is based on the following formula: `key.hashCode() % partitionCount`.
This can be customized on the binding, either by setting a SpEL expression to be evaluated against the 'key' (through the `partitionSelectorExpression` property) or by configuring an implementation of `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionSelectorStrategy` as a bean (by using the @Bean annotation).
Similar to the `PartitionKeyExtractorStrategy`, you can further filter it by using the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorName` property when more than one bean of this type is available in the Application Context, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
--spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorName=customPartitionSelector
. . .
@Bean
public CustomPartitionSelectorClass customPartitionSelector() {
    return new CustomPartitionSelectorClass();
}
----

NOTE: In previous versions of Spring Cloud Stream you could specify the implementation of `org.springframework.cloud.stream.binder.PartitionSelectorStrategy` by setting the `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.producer.partitionSelectorClass` property.
Since version 3.0, this property is removed.

[[spring-cloud-stream-overview-configuring-input-bindings-partitioning]]
==== Configuring Input Bindings for Partitioning

An input binding (with the binding name `uppercase-in-0`) is configured to receive partitioned data by setting its `partitioned`
property, as well as the `instanceIndex` and `instanceCount` properties on the application itself, as shown in the following example:

----
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.uppercase-in-0.consumer.partitioned=true
spring.cloud.stream.instanceIndex=3
spring.cloud.stream.instanceCount=5
----

The `instanceCount` value represents the total number of application instances between which the data should be partitioned.
The `instanceIndex` must be a unique value across the multiple instances, with a value between `0` and `instanceCount - 1`.
The instance index helps each application instance to identify the unique partition(s) from which it receives data.
It is required by binders using technology that does not support partitioning natively.
For example, with RabbitMQ, there is a queue for each partition, with the queue name containing the instance index.
With Kafka, if `autoRebalanceEnabled` is `true` (default), Kafka takes care of distributing partitions across instances, and these properties are not required.
If `autoRebalanceEnabled` is set to false, the `instanceCount` and `instanceIndex` are used by the binder to determine which partition(s) the instance subscribes to (you must have at least as many partitions as there are instances).
The binder allocates the partitions instead of Kafka.
This might be useful if you want messages for a particular partition to always go to the same instance.
When a binder configuration requires them, it is important to set both values correctly in order to ensure that all of the data is consumed and that the application instances receive mutually exclusive datasets.

While a scenario in which using multiple instances for partitioned data processing may be complex to set up in a standalone case, Spring Cloud Dataflow can simplify the process significantly by populating both the input and output values correctly and by letting you rely on the runtime infrastructure to provide information about the instance index and instance count.

== Testing

Spring Cloud Stream provides support for testing your microservice applications without connecting to a messaging system.


[[spring_integration_test_binder]]
=== Spring Integration Test Binder
The old test binder defined in `spring-cloud-stream-test-support` module was specifically designed to facilitate _unit testing_ of the actual messaging components and thus bypasses some of the core functionality of the binder API.

While such light-weight approach is sufficient for a lot of cases, it usually requires additional _integration testing_ with real binders (e.g., Rabbit, Kafka etc). So we are effectively deprecating it.

To begin bridging the gap between _unit_ and _integration_ testing we've developed a new test binder which uses https://spring.io/projects/spring-integration[Spring Integration] framework
as an in-JVM Message Broker essentially giving you the best of both worlds - a real binder without the networking.

==== Test Binder configuration
To enable Spring Integration Test Binder all you need is:

- Add required dependencies
- Remove the dependency for `spring-cloud-stream-test-support`

***Add required dependencies***

Below is the example of the required Maven POM entries which could be easily retrofitted into Gradle.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream</artifactId>
    <version>${spring.cloud.stream.version}</version>
    <type>test-jar</type>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <classifier>test-binder</classifier>
</dependency>
----

***Remove the dependency for `spring-cloud-stream-test-support`***

To avoid conflicts with the existing test binder you must remove the following entry

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-test-support</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

==== Test Binder usage

Now you can test your microservice as a simple unit test

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
public class SampleStreamTests {

	@Autowired
	private InputDestination input;

	@Autowired
	private OutputDestination output;

	@Test
	public void testEmptyConfiguration() {
		this.input.send(new GenericMessage<byte[]>("hello".getBytes()));
		assertThat(output.receive().getPayload()).isEqualTo("HELLO".getBytes());
	}

	@SpringBootApplication
	@Import(TestChannelBinderConfiguration.class)
	public static class SampleConfiguration {
		@Bean
		public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
			return v -> v.toUpperCase();
		}
	}
}
----

And if you need more control or want to test several configurations in the same test suite
you can also do the following:

[source,java]
----
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class MyTestConfiguration {
	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
			return v -> v.toUpperCase();
	}
}

. . .

@Test
public void sampleTest() {
	try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(
				TestChannelBinderConfiguration.getCompleteConfiguration(
						MyTestConfiguration.class))
				.run("--spring.cloud.function.definition=uppercase")) {
		InputDestination source = context.getBean(InputDestination.class);
		OutputDestination target = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);
		source.send(new GenericMessage<byte[]>("hello".getBytes()));
		assertThat(target.receive().getPayload()).isEqualTo("HELLO".getBytes());
	}
}
----

For cases where you have multiple bindings and/or multiple inputs and outputs, the `send()` and `receive()`
methods of `InputDestination` and `OutputDestination` are overridden to allow you to provide index of the input and output destination.

Consider the following sample:
[source,java]
----
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class SampleFunctionConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
		return value -> value.toUpperCase();
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> reverse() {
		return value -> new StringBuilder(value).reverse().toString();
	}
}
----

and the actual test

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testMultipleFunctions() {
	try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(
			TestChannelBinderConfiguration.getCompleteConfiguration(
					SampleFunctionConfiguration.class))
							.run("--spring.cloud.function.definition=uppercase;reverse")) {
		context.getBean(InputDestination.class);

		InputDestination inputDestination = context.getBean(InputDestination.class);
		OutputDestination outputDestination = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);

		Message<byte[]> inputMessage = MessageBuilder.withPayload("Hello".getBytes()).build();
		inputDestination.send(inputMessage, 0);
		inputDestination.send(inputMessage, 1);

		Message<byte[]> outputMessage = outputDestination.receive(0, 0);
		assertThat(outputMessage.getPayload()).isEqualTo("HELLO".getBytes());

		outputMessage = outputDestination.receive(0, 1);
		assertThat(outputMessage.getPayload()).isEqualTo("olleH".getBytes());
	}
}
----

Note, that first we need to provide `spring.cloud.function.definition` property as described in <<Multiple functions in a single application>> section
to declare which functions we intend to use for binding and then use their index (the order of definition in the `spring.cloud.function.definition` property)
to send/receive messages.

You can also use this binder with legacy annotation-based configuration:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class LegacyStreamApplication {

	@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
	@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
	public String echo(String value) {
		return value;
	}
}

. . .

@Test
public void sampleTest() {
	try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(
				TestChannelBinderConfiguration.getCompleteConfiguration(
						LegacyStreamApplication.class)).run()) {
		InputDestination source = context.getBean(InputDestination.class);
		OutputDestination target = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);
		source.send(new GenericMessage<byte[]>("hello".getBytes()));
		assertThat(target.receive().getPayload()).isEqualTo("hello".getBytes());
	}
}
----


In the above you simply create an ApplicationContext with your configuration (your application) while additionally supplying `TestChannelBinderConfiguration`
provided by the framework. Then you access `InputDestination` and `OutputDestination` beans to send/receive messages. In the context of this binder
`InputDestination` and `OutputDestination` emulate remote destinations such as Rabbit _exchange/queue_ or Kafka _topic_.

In the future we plan to simplify the API.

NOTE: In its current state Spring Integration Test Binder only supports the three bindings provided by the framework (Source, Processor, Sink) specifically to promote
light-weight microservices architectures rather then general purpose messaging applications.

==== Test Binder and PollableMessageSource
Spring Integration Test Binder also allows you to write tests when working with `PollableMessageSource` (see <<Using Polled Consumers>> for more details).

The important thing that needs to be understood though is that polling is not event-driven, and that `PollableMessageSource` is a strategy which exposes operation to produce (poll for) a Message (singular).
How often you poll or how many threads you use or where you're polling from (message queue or file system) is entirely up to you;
In other words it is your responsibility to configure Poller or Threads or the actual source of Message. Luckily Spring has plenty of abstractions to configure exactly that.

Let's look at the example:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void samplePollingTest() {
	ApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(SamplePolledConfiguration.class)
				.web(WebApplicationType.NONE)
				.run("--spring.jmx.enabled=false");
	OutputDestination destination = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);
	System.out.println("Message 1: " + new String(destination.receive().getPayload()));
	System.out.println("Message 2: " + new String(destination.receive().getPayload()));
	System.out.println("Message 3: " + new String(destination.receive().getPayload()));
}

@EnableBinding(SamplePolledConfiguration.PolledConsumer.class)
@Import(TestChannelBinderConfiguration.class)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public static class SamplePolledConfiguration {
	@Bean
	public ApplicationRunner poller(PollableMessageSource polledMessageSource, MessageChannel output, TaskExecutor taskScheduler) {
		return args -> {
			taskScheduler.execute(() -> {
				for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
					try {
						if (!polledMessageSource.poll(m -> {
							String newPayload = ((String) m.getPayload()).toUpperCase();
							output.send(new GenericMessage<>(newPayload));
						})) {
							Thread.sleep(2000);
						}
					}
					catch (Exception e) {
						// handle failure
					}
				}
			});
		};
	}

	public static interface PolledConsumer extends Source {
		@Input
		PollableMessageSource pollableSource();
	}
}
----

The above (very rudimentary) example will produce 3 messages in 2 second intervals sending them to the output destination of `Source`
which this binder sends to `OutputDestination` where we retrieve them (for any assertions).
Currently it prints the following:
[source, text]
----
Message 1: POLLED DATA
Message 2: POLLED DATA
Message 3: POLLED DATA
----
As you can see the data is the same. That is because this binder defines a default implementation of the actual `MessageSource` - the source
from which the Messages are polled using `poll()` operation. While sufficient for most testing scenarios, there are cases where you may want
to define your own `MessageSource`. To do so simply configure a bean of type `MessageSource` in your test configuration providing your own
implementation of Message sourcing.

Here is the example:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public MessageSource<?> source() {
	return () -> new GenericMessage<>("My Own Data " + UUID.randomUUID());
}
----
rendering the following output;
[source, text]
----
Message 1: MY OWN DATA 1C180A91-E79F-494F-ABF4-BA3F993710DA
Message 2: MY OWN DATA D8F3A477-5547-41B4-9434-E69DA7616FEE
Message 3: MY OWN DATA 20BF2E64-7FF4-4CB6-A823-4053D30B5C74
----

NOTE: DO NOT name this bean `messageSource` as it is going to be in conflict with the bean of the same name (different type)
provided by Spring Boot for unrelated reasons.


== Health Indicator

Spring Cloud Stream provides a health indicator for binders.
It is registered under the name `binders` and can be enabled or disabled by setting the `management.health.binders.enabled` property.

To enable health check you first need to enable both "web" and "actuator" by including its dependencies (see <<binding_visualization_control>>)

If `management.health.binders.enabled` is not set explicitly by the application, then `management.health.defaults.enabled` is matched as `true` and the binder health indicators are enabled.
If you want to disable health indicator completely, then you have to set `management.health.binders.enabled` to `false`.

You can use Spring Boot actuator health endpoint to access the health indicator - `/actuator/health`.
By default, you will only receive the top level application status when you hit the above endpoint.
In order to receive the full details from the binder specific health indicators, you need to include the property `management.endpoint.health.show-details` with the value `ALWAYS` in your application.

Health indicators are binder-specific and certain binder implementations may not necessarily provide a health indicator.

If you want to completely disable all health indicators available out of the box and instead provide your own health indicators,
you can do so by setting property `management.health.binders.enabled` to `false` and then provide your own `HealthIndicator` beans in your application.
In this case, the health indicator infrastructure from Spring Boot will still pick up these custom beans.
Even if you are not disabling the binder health indicators, you can still enhance the health checks by providing your own `HealthIndicator` beans in addition to the out of the box health checks.

When you have multiple binders in the same application, health indicators are enabled by default unless the application turns them off by setting `management.health.binders.enabled` to `false`.
In this case, if the user wants to disable health check for a subset of the binders, then that should be done by setting `management.health.binders.enabled` to `false` in the multi binder configurations's environment.
See <<multiple-systems,Connecting to Multiple Systems>> for details on how environment specific properties can be provided.

If there are multiple binders present in the classpath but not all of them are used in the application, this may cause some issues in the context of health indicators.
There may be implementation specific details as to how the health checks are performed. For example, a Kafka binder may decide the status as `DOWN` if there are no destinations registered by the binder.
For this reason, if you include a binder in the classpath, it is advised to use that binder by providing at least one binding (for E.g. through `EnableBinding`).
If you don't have any bindings to provide for this binder, then that is an indication that you don't need to include that binder in the classpath.

Lets take a concrete situation. Imagine you have both Kafka and Kafka Streams binders present in the classpath, but only use the Kafka Streams binder in the application code, i.e. only provide bindings using the Kafka Streams binder.
Since Kafka binder is not used and it has specific checks to see if any destinations are registered, the binder health heck will fail.
The top level application health check status will be reported as `DOWN`.
In this situation, you can simply remove the dependency for kafka binder from your application since you are not using it.

== Samples

For Spring Cloud Stream samples, see the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-samples[spring-cloud-stream-samples] repository on GitHub.

=== Deploying Stream Applications on CloudFoundry

On CloudFoundry, services are usually exposed through a special environment variable called https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES[VCAP_SERVICES].

When configuring your binder connections, you can use the values from an environment variable as explained on the http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-cloudfoundry/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-ups[dataflow Cloud Foundry Server] docs.

== Binder Implementations

The following is the list of available binder implementations

* https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit/[RabbitMQ]
* https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/[Apache Kafka]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-aws-kinesis[Amazon Kinesis]
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub-stream-binder[Google PubSub _(partner maintained)_]
* https://github.com/SolaceProducts/spring-cloud-stream-binder-solace[Solace PubSub+ _(partner maintained)_]
* https://github.com/Microsoft/spring-cloud-azure/tree/master/spring-cloud-azure-stream-binder/spring-cloud-azure-eventhubs-stream-binder[Azure Event Hubs _(partner maintained)_]
* https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/wiki/RocketMQ-en[Apache RocketMQ _(partner maintained)_]

As it was mentioned earlier Binder abstraction is also one of the extension points of the framework. So if you can't find a suitable binder in the preceding list you can implement your own binder on top of Spring Cloud Stream.
