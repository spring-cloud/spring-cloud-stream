|Name | Default | Description

|spring.cloud.stream.binders |  | Additional per-binder properties (see {@link BinderProperties}) if more then one binder of the same type is used (i.e., connect to multiple instances of RabbitMq). Here you can specify multiple binder configurations, each with different environment settings. For example; spring.cloud.stream.binders.rabbit1.environment. . . , spring.cloud.stream.binders.rabbit2.environment. . .
|spring.cloud.stream.binding-retry-interval | `30` | Retry interval (in seconds) used to schedule binding attempts. Default: 30 sec.
|spring.cloud.stream.bindings |  | Additional binding properties (see {@link BinderProperties}) per binding name (e.g., 'input`). For example; This sets the content-type for the 'input' binding of a Sink application: 'spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.contentType=text/plain'
|spring.cloud.stream.default-binder |  | The name of the binder to use by all bindings in the event multiple binders available (e.g., 'rabbit').
|spring.cloud.stream.dynamic-destination-cache-size | `10` | The maximum size of Least Recently Used (LRU) cache of dynamic destinations. Once this size is reached, new destinations will trigger the removal of old destinations. Default: 10
|spring.cloud.stream.dynamic-destinations | `[]` | A list of destinations that can be bound dynamically. If set, only listed destinations can be bound.
|spring.cloud.stream.function.batch-mode | `false` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings |  | 
|spring.cloud.stream.instance-count | `1` | The number of deployed instances of an application. Default: 1. NOTE: Could also be managed per individual binding "spring.cloud.stream.bindings.foo.consumer.instance-count" where 'foo' is the name of the binding.
|spring.cloud.stream.instance-index | `0` | The instance id of the application: a number from 0 to instanceCount-1. Used for partitioning and with Kafka. NOTE: Could also be managed per individual binding "spring.cloud.stream.bindings.foo.consumer.instance-index" where 'foo' is the name of the binding.
|spring.cloud.stream.instance-index-list |  | A list of instance id's from 0 to instanceCount-1. Used for partitioning and with Kafka. NOTE: Could also be managed per individual binding "spring.cloud.stream.bindings.foo.consumer.instance-index-list" where 'foo' is the name of the binding. This setting will override the one set in 'spring.cloud.stream.instance-index'
|spring.cloud.stream.integration.message-handler-not-propagated-headers |  | Message header names that will NOT be copied from the inbound message.
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.authorization-exception-retry-interval |  | Time between retries after AuthorizationException is caught in the ListenerContainer; defalt is null which disables retries. For more info see: {@link org.springframework.kafka.listener.ConsumerProperties#setAuthorizationExceptionRetryInterval(java.time.Duration)}
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.auto-add-partitions | `false` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.auto-alter-topics | `false` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.auto-create-topics | `true` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.brokers | `[localhost]` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.certificate-store-directory |  | When a certificate store location is given as classpath URL (classpath:), then the binder moves the resource from the classpath location inside the JAR to a location on the filesystem. If this value is set, then this location is used, otherwise, the certificate file is copied to the directory returned by java.io.tmpdir.
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.configuration |  | Arbitrary kafka properties that apply to both producers and consumers.
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.consider-down-when-any-partition-has-no-leader | `false` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.consumer-properties |  | Arbitrary kafka consumer properties.
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.header-mapper-bean-name |  | The bean name of a custom header mapper to use instead of a {@link org.springframework.kafka.support.DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper}.
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.headers | `[]` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.health-timeout | `60` | Time to wait to get partition information in seconds; default 60.
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.jaas |  | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.min-partition-count | `1` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.producer-properties |  | Arbitrary kafka producer properties.
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.replication-factor | `-1` | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.required-acks | `1` |

|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.header-patterns |  | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.message-key-expression |  | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.partition-count |  | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.partition-key-expression |  | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.producer.partition-key-extractor-name |  |

|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.binder.transaction.transaction-id-prefix |  | 
|spring.cloud.stream.kafka.bindings |  | 
|spring.cloud.stream.metrics.export-properties |  | List of properties that are going to be appended to each message. This gets populate by onApplicationEvent, once the context refreshes to avoid overhead of doing per message basis.
|spring.cloud.stream.metrics.key |  | The name of the metric being emitted. Should be an unique value per application. Defaults to: ${spring.application.name:${vcap.application.name:${spring.config.name:application}}}.
|spring.cloud.stream.metrics.meter-filter |  | Pattern to control the 'meters' one wants to capture. By default all 'meters' will be captured. For example, 'spring.integration.*' will only capture metric information for meters whose name starts with 'spring.integration'.
|spring.cloud.stream.metrics.properties |  | Application properties that should be added to the metrics payload For example: `spring.application**`.
|spring.cloud.stream.metrics.schedule-interval | `60s` | Interval expressed as Duration for scheduling metrics snapshots publishing. Defaults to 60 seconds
|spring.cloud.stream.override-cloud-connectors | `false` | This property is only applicable when the cloud profile is active and Spring Cloud Connectors are provided with the application. If the property is false (the default), the binder detects a suitable bound service (for example, a RabbitMQ service bound in Cloud Foundry for the RabbitMQ binder) and uses it for creating connections (usually through Spring Cloud Connectors). When set to true, this property instructs binders to completely ignore the bound services and rely on Spring Boot properties (for example, relying on the spring.rabbitmq.* properties provided in the environment for the RabbitMQ binder). The typical usage of this property is to be nested in a customized environment when connecting to multiple systems.
|spring.cloud.stream.pollable-source | `none` | A semi-colon delimited list of binding names of pollable sources. Binding names follow the same naming convention as functions. For example, name '...pollable-source=foobar' will be accessible as 'foobar-iin-0'' binding
|spring.cloud.stream.poller.cron |  | Cron expression value for the Cron Trigger.
|spring.cloud.stream.poller.fixed-delay | `1000` | Fixed delay for default poller.
|spring.cloud.stream.poller.initial-delay | `0` | Initial delay for periodic triggers.
|spring.cloud.stream.poller.max-messages-per-poll | `1` | Maximum messages per poll for the default poller.
|spring.cloud.stream.poller.time-unit |  | The TimeUnit to apply to delay values.
|spring.cloud.stream.sendto.destination | `none` | The name of the header used to determine the name of the output destination
|spring.cloud.stream.source |  | A colon delimited string representing the names of the sources based on which source bindings will be created.  This is primarily to support cases where source binding may be required without providing a corresponding Supplier.  (e.g., for cases where the actual source of data is outside of scope of spring-cloud-stream - HTTP -> Stream)
