Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications.
Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers.
It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.
These are called binder implementations in the parlance of Spring Cloud Stream.
Out of the box, Spring Cloud Stream provides binder implementations for Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ.
While these two binder implementations are based on Message Channels, Spring Cloud Stream also provides another binder implementation for Kafka Streams that does not use message channels, but native Kafka Streams types such as KStream, KTable etc.

Below, you can find more information on how to use these various out-of-the-box binder implementations in your applications.

== Apache Kafka Binder

=== Usage

To use Apache Kafka binder, you need to add `spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka` as a dependency to your Spring Cloud Stream application, as shown in the following example for Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can also use the Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Starter, as shown in the following example for Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Apache Kafka Streams Binder

=== Usage

To use Apache Kafka Streams binder, you need to add `spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka-streams` as a dependency to your Spring Cloud Stream application, as shown in the following example for Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka-streams</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== RabbitMQ Binder
=== Usage

To use the RabbitMQ binder, you can add it to your Spring Cloud Stream application, by using the following Maven coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can use the Spring Cloud Stream RabbitMQ Starter, as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
