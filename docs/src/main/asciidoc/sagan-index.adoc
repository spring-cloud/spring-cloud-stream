Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.

The framework provides a flexible programming model built on already established and familiar Spring idioms and best practices, including support
for persistent pub/sub semantics, consumer groups, and stateful partitions.

## Binder Implementations

Spring Cloud Stream supports a variety of binder implementations and the following table includes the link to the GitHub projects.

The core building blocks of Spring Cloud Stream are:

* *Destination Binders*: Components responsible to provide integration with the external messaging systems.
* *Destination Bindings*: Bridge between the external messaging systems and application provided Producers and Consumers of messages (created by the Destination Binders).
* *Message*: The canonical data structure used by producers and consumers to communicate with Destination Binders (and thus other applications via external messaging systems).
